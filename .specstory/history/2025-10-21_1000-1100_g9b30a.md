**User Message:** I feel that persistance of the knowledge should be done in a graph-DB, not an mySQL (table oriented) DB. Revise the documentation and codebase to remind ourselves what we wanted to use DuckDB for (time evolutions? <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> data?), what the Qdrant vector DB is for and research (web) what locally hostable graphDB could/should be (/is!! graphology?) used to store knowledge. I feel that our storage landscape in coding is too complicated already - maybe we should get rid of the integra...
