**User Message:**  Deleted badly-named PNG files:\
--> did you also delete the underlying puml files? Are they not used anymore? Why did they exist then?!\
\
Also, why are we using "deprecated" code? Are we using this at all? Why is it deprecated and, if so, should it not be replaced by something that's not deprecated? Weird... '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/_obsolete/deprecated-retry-logic.ts'

### Edit - 2026-01-03 08:12:52 UTC [09:12:52 CEST]

**User Request:** you have png files in the puml folder (should be images) - move and correct references in md's. Example (there are others): '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>agent-agnostic-architecture-new.png' ... this filename is also incremental (why did our constraint not catch this?)... correct

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.constraint-monitor.yaml",
  "old_string": "- id: plantuml-file-organization\n  group: plantuml\n  pattern: \\.puml$\n  message: 'PlantUML files should follow naming convention: component-purpose.puml'\n  severity: info\n  enabled: true\n  suggestion: Use descriptive names like workflow-sequence.puml, architecture-overview.puml\n- id: image-reference-pattern",
  "new_string": "- id: plantuml-file-organization\n  group: plantuml\n  pattern: \\.puml$\n  message: 'PlantUML files should follow naming convention: component-purpose.puml'\n  severity: info\n  enabled: true\n  suggestion: Use descriptive names like workflow-sequence.puml, architecture-overview.puml\n- id: plantuml-diagram-name-format\n  group: plantuml\n  pattern: '@startuml\\s+(?:[A-Z]|.*\\s+.*|.*(?:v[2-9]|enhanced|improved|better|new|advanced|pro|simplified|simple|basic|lite|fixed|patched|updated|revised|modified|temp|temporary|backup|copy|duplicate|clone|alt|alternative|variant|final|draft|experimental|old)[ ._-])'\n  message: 'CRITICAL: @startuml diagram name must be lowercase-hyphenated without spaces or version suffixes (determines output PNG filename)'\n  severity: critical\n  enabled: true\n  applies_to: content\n  suggestion: 'Change @startuml My Diagram Name to @startuml my-diagram-name (must match filename without .puml extension)'\n- id: image-reference-pattern"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
The file /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.constraint-monitor.yaml has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:
