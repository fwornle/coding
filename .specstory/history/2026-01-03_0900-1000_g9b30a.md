**User Message:**  Deleted badly-named PNG files:\
--> did you also delete the underlying puml files? Are they not used anymore? Why did they exist then?!\
\
Also, why are we using "deprecated" code? Are we using this at all? Why is it deprecated and, if so, should it not be replaced by something that's not deprecated? Weird... '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/_obsolete/deprecated-retry-logic.ts'
