# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Create PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "activeForm": "Creating PlantUML diagrams"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create frontend-architecture.md documentation",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Creating frontend architecture documentation"
    },
    {
      "content": "Update navigation and link to main docs",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Updating navigation"
    },
    {
      "content": "Commit and push changes",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Committing changes"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
Todos have been modified successfully. Ensure that you continue to use the todo list to track your progress. Please proceed with the current tasks if applicable

- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs-content/puml/mvi-data-flow.puml",

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

  "description": "Copy standard style to project"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml",
  "content": "@startuml redux-store-structure\n!include _standard-style.puml\n\ntitle Redux Store Structure\n\nskinparam backgroundColor white\nskinparam packageStyle rectangle\n\npackage \"Redux Store\" as Store #LightYellow {\n\n  package \"authSlice\" as Auth #LightPink {\n    object \"state\" as AuthState {\n      user: User | null\n      tokens: AuthTokens | null\n      isAuthenticated: boolean\n      isLoading: boolean\n      error: string | null\n    }\n  }\n\n  package \"preferencesSlice\" as Prefs #LightGreen {\n    object \"state\" as PrefsState {\n      theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system'\n    }\n  }\n\n  package \"loggingSlice\" as Logging #LightCyan {\n    object \"state\" as LoggingState {\n      activeLevels: string[]\n      activeCategories: string[]\n    }\n  }\n\n  package \"apiStatusSlice\" as ApiStatus #LightBlue {\n    object \"state\" as ApiStatusState {\n      health: HealthResponse | null\n      version: VersionResponse | null\n      config: ConfigResponse | null\n      loading: boolean\n      error: string | null\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n\nnote right of Store\n  configureStore() combines\n  all slices into single store\n\n  Access via:\n  - useAppSelector()\n  - useAppDispatch()\nend note\n\n@enduml\n"

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)

}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml",

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs-content/puml && for f in *.puml; do echo \"=== $f ===\" && plantuml -checkonly \"$f\" 2>&1; done",
  "description": "Check each PlantUML file individually"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
=== _standard-style.puml ===
=== api-request-flow.puml ===
=== architecture-overview.puml ===
=== authentication-flow.puml ===
=== authentication-token-flow.puml ===
=== aws-architecture.puml ===
=== cicd-flow.puml ===
=== component-hierarchy.puml ===
Some diagram description contains errors

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
     1→@startuml component-hierarchy
     2→!include _standard-style.puml
     3→

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
     1→@startuml logging-system
     2→!include _standard-style.puml
     3→

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "for f in mvi-data-flow.puml redux-store-structure.puml authentication-token-flow.puml component-hierarchy.puml logging-system.puml api-request-flow.puml; do echo \"=== $f ===\" && plantuml -checkonly \"$f\" 2>&1; done",
  "description": "Check each file individually"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
=== mvi-data-flow.puml ===
=== redux-store-structure.puml ===
=== authentication-token-flow.puml ===
=== component-hierarchy.puml ===
Some diagram description contains errors
=== logging-system.puml ===
Some diagram description contains errors
=== api-request-flow.puml ===
```

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

## PRESENTATION MODE

### When to Use Presentation Mode

Create a presentation mode version when:
- User explicitly requests "presentation mode" or "PPT version"
- Diagram will be used in PowerPoint or similar presentation software
- Diagram needs to be readable from distance (projector/large screen)
- Focus should be on key concepts, not detailed annotations

### Presentation Mode Workflow

When asked to create a presentation mode version:

1. **Copy source file** from `docs/puml/` to `coding/docs/presentation/puml/`
   - Keep the same filename (no suffix changes)
   - This is stored in coding project for reuse across all projects

2. **Rework the diagram** with these changes:
   - **Thicker lines**: All connections and borders become more prominent
   - **Increased font size**: All text becomes larger (18pt vs 12pt)
   - **Essential text only**: Remove verbose labels, keep only critical identifiers
   - **Remove annotations**: Delete all notes, legends, and explanatory text
   - **Horizontal layout**: Arrange for landscape PPT slide (left-to-right flow)
   - **Simplify**: Focus on core concepts, remove implementation details

3. **Update style sheet include** to presentation style:

   **Absolute path** (when referencing from any project):
   ```
   !include /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml
   ```

   **Relative path** (when file is in the presentation/puml directory):
   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

### Presentation Mode Characteristics

**Differences from Standard Mode**:

| Aspect | Standard Mode | Presentation Mode |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Layout | Vertical (narrow, tall) | Horizontal (wide, landscape) |
| Font Size | 12pt | 18pt |
| Line Thickness | 2pt | 3-4pt |
| Text Detail | Comprehensive | Essential only |
| Annotations | Included | Removed |
| Notes/Legends | Present | Omitted |
| Purpose | Documentation | Presentation |
| Location | `docs/puml/` | `coding/docs/presentation/puml/` |

**Visual Optimization**:
- Thicker borders make elements visible from distance
- Larger fonts readable on projectors
- Horizontal layout fits 16:9 or 4:3 PPT slides
- Minimal text reduces cognitive load
- No legends/notes - slides should be self-explanatory or presenter explains

### Presentation Mode Example

**Original** (docs/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Vertical layout with detailed steps
- Includes notes about JWT validation
- Legend showing message types
- 12pt fonts, standard arrows

**Presentation** (coding/docs/presentation/puml/authentication-flow.puml):
- Horizontal left-to-right flow
- Only shows: User → API → Auth → DB
- No notes or legends
- 18pt fonts, thick arrows (4pt)
- Labels: "Login", "Validate", "Query" (not "POST /api/v1/auth/login with credentials")

### Important Notes

- **Same filename**: Presentation versions use same name as original (no suffix)
- **Different location**: Stored in coding/docs/presentation/ tree
- **Not versioning**: This is a different presentation format, not a version
- **Reusable**: Presentation mode diagrams in coding/ can be used by all projects
- **Update both**: When updating a diagram, update both standard and presentation if needed

## Automation Opportunities

Consider creating helper scripts for:
- Batch validation of all .puml files
- Automated PNG generation on save
- Pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions
- Linting for incremental naming patterns
- Automatic presentation mode conversion

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml",
  "content": "@startuml component-hierarchy\n!include _standard-style.puml\n\ntitle React Component Hierarchy\n\nrectangle \"App Entry\" {\n  rectangle \"main\" as Main\n  rectangle \"App\" as App\n}\n\nrectangle \"Providers\" {\n  rectangle \"Redux Provider\" as ReduxProvider\n  rectangle \"ThemeProvider\" as ThemeProvider\n  rectangle \"RouterProvider\" as RouterProvider\n}\n\nrectangle \"Layout\" as LayoutPkg {\n  rectangle \"Layout\" as Layout\n  rectangle \"TopBar\" as TopBar\n  rectangle \"BottomBar\" as BottomBar\n}\n\nrectangle \"Pages\" {\n  rectangle \"HomePage\" as Home\n  rectangle \"AboutPage\" as About\n}\n\nrectangle \"Features\" {\n  rectangle \"Counter\" as Counter\n  rectangle \"ApiStatus\" as ApiStatus\n}\n\nrectangle \"Auth Components\" {\n  rectangle \"LoginModal\" as Login\n  rectangle \"UserMenu\" as UserMenu\n}\n\nrectangle \"Settings\" as SettingsPkg {\n  rectangle \"SettingsModal\" as Settings\n  rectangle \"LoggingSettings\" as LogSettings\n  rectangle \"ThemeSettings\" as ThemeSettings\n}\n\nMain -down-> App\nApp -down-> ReduxProvider\nReduxProvider -down-> ThemeProvider\nThemeProvider -down-> RouterProvider\nRouterProvider -down-> Layout\n\nLayout -down-> TopBar\nLayout -down-> Home\nLayout -down-> BottomBar\n\nTopBar -down-> Login\nTopBar -down-> UserMenu\nTopBar -down-> Settings\n\nHome -down-> Counter\nHome -down-> ApiStatus\n\nSettings -down-> LogSettings\nSettings -down-> ThemeSettings\n\n@enduml\n"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: Text-based "line art" is not accessible, difficult to maintain, and looks unprofessional.

### 2. PlantUML Diagram Standards

**Location**: All PlantUML files MUST be stored in `docs/puml/`

**Style Sheet**: ALWAYS include the standard style sheet from coding project as the FIRST line after the opening tag.

**Layout Guidelines**:
- **Standard diagrams**: Prefer VERTICAL layouts to avoid excessive width
- Reason: Prevents users from zooming and scrolling horizontally
- Vertical scrolling is acceptable and preferred over horizontal scrolling
- Aim for narrow, tall diagrams that fit within typical screen widths

**Workflow for Creating PlantUML Diagrams**:

1. **Create the .puml file** in `docs/puml/` with proper naming
2. **Include standard style** - see reference documentation for the exact include syntax
3. **Design with vertical layout** - stack components top-to-bottom when possible
4. **Validate syntax** by attempting to render with plantuml checkonly flag
5. **Fix any errors** reported by plantuml validation
6. **Generate PNG** once error-free using plantuml command
7. **Move PNG to images folder** in docs/images/
8. **Reference in markdown** using relative path to the image

**IMPORTANT**: Never claim success until you've verified the PNG was created without errors.

### 3. Filename Conventions

**STRICT RULES** for ALL documentation artifacts (`.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.):

**Permitted characters**:
- Lowercase letters: `a-z`
- Hyphens: `-`
- Numbers: `0-9`
- Extensions: `.md`, `.puml`, `.png`, etc.

**ONLY permitted exception**: `README.md` (capital letters allowed)

**Good Examples**:
- `system-architecture.puml`
- `deployment-flow.md`
- `api-endpoints.png`
- `README.md` (exception)

**Bad Examples**:
- Capital letters in names
- Underscores instead of hyphens
- CamelCase or PascalCase naming

### 4. NO INCREMENTAL NAMING

**CRITICAL**: Filenames and diagram text MUST represent the CURRENT STATE only, never showing evolution.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS** - Never use these suffixes or words:
- Version numbers or indicators
- Words suggesting improvement or change
- Words suggesting temporary status
- Words suggesting alternatives

**Why**: Documentation should reflect current state, not history. Use git for version history.

**Always**: Update the original file directly instead of creating variants.

### 5. Diagram Text Content

Text WITHIN diagrams must also be non-incremental:
- Component names should be simple and current
- Node labels should not indicate versions
- Actor names should not suggest enhancement status

## Implementation Checklist

When creating or updating documentation, verify:

- [ ] No ASCII/line art used (use PlantUML or Mermaid)
- [ ] PlantUML files stored in `docs/puml/`
- [ ] Standard style sheet included in .puml files
- [ ] PlantUML syntax validated with plantuml checkonly
- [ ] PNG generated successfully with plantuml
- [ ] PNG moved to `docs/images/`
- [ ] All filenames use lowercase + hyphens only (except README.md)
- [ ] No incremental suffixes in filenames
- [ ] No incremental labels in diagram text
- [ ] Markdown properly references images from `docs/images/`

## Tool Requirements

**Required tool**: `plantuml` must be installed on the system.

**Verification**:
```bash
which plantuml || echo "ERROR: plantuml not installed"
```

## Error Recovery

If PlantUML generation fails:

1. **Read the error message carefully** - PlantUML errors are usually specific
2. **Check syntax** - common issues include missing tags, unclosed quotes, invalid stereotypes, incorrect arrow syntax
3. **Validate include path** - ensure style sheet path is correct
4. **Test incrementally** - comment out sections to isolate problems

## Project-Specific Paths

### Standard Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for regular documentation diagrams (12pt fonts, 2pt lines, vertical layout preference).

### Presentation Mode Style Sheet
Located at: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

Use this path for presentation diagrams (18pt fonts, 3-4pt lines, horizontal layout preference).

**IMPORTANT**: Both style sheets are named `_standard-style.puml` but are in different directories. The constraint monitor requires all PlantUML files to include a file named `_standard-style.puml`, so we use the same name in both locations but with different content optimized for each use case.

   ```
   !include _standard-style.puml
   ```

   Note: This is a different `_standard-style.puml` than the regular one - it's the presentation mode version with larger fonts and thicker lines.

4. **Validate and generate**:
   ```bash
   plantuml -checkonly coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   plantuml coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.puml
   mv coding/docs/presentation/puml/diagram-name.png coding/docs/presentation/images/
   ```

5. **Verify** the presentation PNG is created and suitable for PPT use

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial context**: This is a continuation from a previous session about the UI Template project with React, AWS, SST v3 deployment.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.
   
   User's request: "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"
   
   Current todo list shows:
   1. [in_progress] Create PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture
   2. [pending] Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   3. [pending] Update navigation and link to main docs
   4. [pending] Commit and push changes.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.
   
   User's request: "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.
   
   User's request: "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial context**: This is a continuation from a previous session about the UI Template project with React, AWS, SST v3 deployment.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.
   
   User's request: "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg.

Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"
   
   Current todo list shows:
   1. [in_progress] Create PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture
   2. [pending] Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   3. [pending] Update navigation and link to main docs
   4. [pending] Commit and push changes.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial context**: This is a continuation from a previous session about the UI Template project with React, AWS, SST v3 deployment.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.
   
   User's request: "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg.

### Write - 2025-12-06 07:29:01 UTC [08:29:01 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial context**: This is a continuation from a previous session about the UI Template project with React, AWS, SST v3 deployment.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

  "content": "# Frontend Architecture\n\nThis document explains the architectural patterns and design decisions used in the UI template.\n\n## MVI Pattern & Unidirectional Data Flow\n\nThe application follows the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** pattern with unidirectional data flow:\n\n![MVI Data Flow](./puml/mvi-data-flow.png)\n\n| Layer | Responsibility | Implementation |\n|-------|---------------|----------------|\n| **View** | Render UI, capture user interactions | React components |\n| **Intent** | Transform user actions into state changes | Action dispatches, async thunks |\n| **Model** | Single source of truth for app state | Redux store |\n\n**Data flows in one direction only:**\n\n1. **View** captures user interaction (click, input, form submit)\n2. **Intent** dispatches an action or async thunk\n3. **Model** updates state via reducers\n4. **View** re-renders with new state via `useSelector()`\n\nThis pattern ensures predictable state management and makes debugging straightforward.\n\n---\n\n## Component Hierarchy\n\n![Component Hierarchy](./puml/component-hierarchy.png)\n\nThe component tree follows this structure:\n\n```\nmain.tsx\n└── App.tsx\n    └── Redux Provider\n        └── ThemeProvider\n            └── RouterProvider\n                └── Layout\n                    ├── TopBar (LoginModal, UserMenu, SettingsModal)\n                    ├── Page Content (HomePage, AboutPage)\n                    └── BottomBar\n```\n\n**Key patterns:**\n\n- **Providers wrap the entire app** - Redux, Theme, and Router contexts available everywhere\n- **Layout handles structure** - Consistent TopBar and BottomBar across all pages\n- **Feature components are self-contained** - Counter, ApiStatus manage their own state access\n\n---\n\n## Redux Store Structure\n\nState management uses Redux Toolkit with typed slices:\n\n![Redux Store Structure](./puml/redux-store-structure.png)\n\n### Slices Overview\n\n| Slice | Purpose | Key State |\n|-------|---------|-----------|\n| `authSlice` | User authentication | `user`, `tokens`, `isAuthenticated` |\n| `preferencesSlice` | User preferences | `theme` (light/dark/system) |\n| `loggingSlice` | Console logging control | `activeLevels`, `activeCategories` |\n| `apiStatusSlice` | API health monitoring | `health`, `version`, `config` |\n\n### Typed Hooks\n\n```typescript\n// src/store/hooks.ts\nexport const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();\nexport const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;\n```\n\nUsage in components:\n\n```typescript\nconst isAuthenticated = useAppSelector((state) => state.auth.isAuthenticated);\nconst dispatch = useAppDispatch();\ndispatch(loginUser({ username, password }));\n```\n\n---\n\n## Authentication & Token Management\n\nThe app uses AWS Cognito for authentication with JWT tokens:\n\n![Authentication Token Flow](./puml/authentication-token-flow.png)\n\n### Token Types\n\n| Token | Purpose | Lifetime |\n|-------|---------|----------|\n| **Access Token** | API authorization | 1 hour |\n| **ID Token** | User identity claims | 1 hour |\n| **Refresh Token** | Get new access tokens | 30 days |\n\n### Authentication Flow\n\n1. **Login** - User credentials sent to Cognito via SRP authentication\n2. **Token Storage** - Tokens persisted to localStorage\n3. **Auto-Refresh** - Access token refreshed before expiry (5-min buffer)\n4. **Logout** - Tokens cleared, Cognito session invalidated\n\n### Using Authentication\n\n```typescript\n// src/hooks/useAuth.ts\nconst { user, isAuthenticated, login, signOut } = useAuth();\n\n// Login\nawait login({ username: '<EMAIL_REDACTED>', password: 'secret' });\n\n// Protected content\nif (isAuthenticated) {\n  console.log(`Hello ${user.email}`);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## API Request Flow\n\nAPI calls handle authentication automatically:\n\n![API Request Flow](./puml/api-request-flow.png)\n\n### API Client Structure\n\n```typescript\n// src/services/apiClient.ts\nexport const api = {\n  public: {\n    health: () => client.get('/api/health'),\n    version: () => client.get('/api/version'),\n  },\n  user: {\n    getProfile: () => authClient.get('/api/user/profile'),\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Request Handling\n\n| Scenario | Behavior |\n|----------|----------|\n| Public endpoint | Direct request, no auth header |\n| Protected endpoint | Attach `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |\n| Token expired (401) | Auto-refresh tokens, retry request |\n| Request failure | Log error, throw `ApiError` |\n\n---\n\n## Browser Logging System\n\nThe custom Logger provides categorized, colored console output:\n\n![Logging System](./puml/logging-system.png)\n\n### Log Levels\n\n```typescript\nLogger.error('AUTH', 'Login failed:', error);  // Always shown\nLogger.warn('API', 'Slow response:', ms);       // Important warnings\nLogger.info('STORE', 'State updated');          // General info\nLogger.debug('UI', 'Component rendered');       // Debugging\nLogger.trace('THEME', 'Color calculated');

### Read - 2025-12-06 07:29:01 UTC [08:29:01 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial context**: This is a continuation from a previous session about the UI Template project with React, AWS, SST v3 deployment.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.
   
   User's request: "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg.

   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.
   
   User's request: "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial context**: This is a continuation from a previous session about the UI Template project with React, AWS, SST v3 deployment.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml

     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)

     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.

### Edit - 2025-12-06 07:29:01 UTC [08:29:01 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial context**: This is a continuation from a previous session about the UI Template project with React, AWS, SST v3 deployment.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.
   
   User's request: "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial context**: This is a continuation from a previous session about the UI Template project with React, AWS, SST v3 deployment.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.
   
   User's request: "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg.

### Bash - 2025-12-06 07:29:01 UTC [08:29:01 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial context**: This is a continuation from a previous session about the UI Template project with React, AWS, SST v3 deployment.

2. **Documentation consolidation**: User asked to make documentation "super concise" - I consolidated 6 files (2,231 lines) into 3 files (511 lines): index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md.

3. **Test workflow screenshot**: User showed successful GitHub Actions test workflow run.

4. **GitHub Actions documentation request**: User asked to document the two GH Action pipelines (deploy and docs) with screenshots:
   - `gh-actions.png` - overview of all workflows
   - `gh-actions-deploy-feature.png` - deploy workflow details
   - Referenced the updated `web-app.png` showing API Status feature

5. **Documentation pipeline clarification**: User asked why docs still showed old screenshot - I explained docs only deploy from `main` branch. I merged develop to main.

6. **User requested**: Document that docs pipeline only runs from main branch.

7. **Documentation site screenshot**: User asked to include `docu-deployed.png` screenshot and link to the live documentation.

8. **AWS permissions issue**: User ran setup.sh on corporate Coder cloud machine and got IAM permission error for S3 CreateBucket. I explained this is because the Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions.

9. **Frontend architecture documentation request**: User asked for detailed frontend developer documentation explaining:
   - MVI and unidirectional data flow
   - Redux and slices for state management
   - Browser persistence
   - Authentication and token management
   - Logging via Logger class
   - With PlantUML diagrams

10. **Current work**: Creating PlantUML diagrams for frontend architecture. I created:
   - `mvi-data-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `redux-store-structure.puml` - validates OK
   - `authentication-token-flow.puml` - validates OK
   - `component-hierarchy.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax
   - `logging-system.puml` - had errors, fixed to use rectangles instead of mixed syntax
   - `api-request-flow.puml` - validates OK

11. **PlantUML errors**: Files with `[...]` component syntax and dots in names (`.tsx`, `.ts`) caused errors. Fixed by using `rectangle` syntax instead.

Still in progress: validating the fixed PlantUML files and generating PNGs, then creating the frontend-architecture.md documentation.

Key files modified:
- docs-content/getting-started.md - added GitHub Actions pipelines section with screenshots
- docs-content/index.md - added caption to web-app.png
- Created 6 new PlantUML files in docs-content/puml/

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Consolidate documentation into lean 3-file structure (completed)
   - Document GitHub Actions pipelines with screenshots showing Deploy, Test, and Documentation workflows
   - Clarify documentation pipeline only runs from `main` branch
   - Include screenshot of deployed documentation site with link
   - **Current main request**: Create frontend developer documentation explaining MVI architecture, Redux state management, browser persistence, authentication/token management, and Logger system - all with PlantUML diagrams

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - MVI (Model-View-Intent) unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Redux Toolkit with slices (authSlice, preferencesSlice, loggingSlice, apiStatusSlice)
   - JWT token management (access, refresh, ID tokens)
   - AWS Cognito authentication with Amplify SDK
   - Browser localStorage persistence
   - Custom Logger class with categories and levels
   - SST v3 for infrastructure as code
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy.yml, test.yml, deploy-docs.yml)
   - PlantUML diagram generation

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **docs-content/getting-started.md** - Updated with GitHub Actions pipelines section
     ```markdown
     ### Documentation Pipeline
     
     Deploys MkDocs to GitHub Pages **only from `main` branch**:
     
     ![Documentation Site](./images/docu-deployed.png)
     *Live documentation at [fwornle.github.io/ui-template](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/redux-store-structure.puml** - Redux store structure (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/authentication-token-flow.puml** - Auth sequence diagram (validates OK)

   - **docs-content/puml/component-hierarchy.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles
     ```plantuml
     @startuml component-hierarchy
     !include _standard-style.puml
     title React Component Hierarchy
     rectangle "App Entry" {
       rectangle "main" as Main
       rectangle "App" as App
     }
     rectangle "Providers" {
       rectangle "Redux Provider" as ReduxProvider
       ...
     }
     @enduml
     ```

   - **docs-content/puml/logging-system.puml** - Fixed to use rectangles instead of component syntax

   - **docs-content/puml/api-request-flow.puml** - API request sequence with token management (validates OK)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **PlantUML validation errors for component-hierarchy.puml and logging-system.puml**:
     - Cause: Using `[ComponentName.tsx]` syntax with dots and brackets caused parsing errors
     - Fix: Changed from `[component]` syntax to `rectangle "name"` syntax
     - Changed `[Layout.tsx] as Layout` to `rectangle "Layout" as Layout`
   
   - **Constraint violation for PlantUML include path**:
     - Error: "PlantUML files must include the standard styling file"
     - Fix: Copied `_standard-style.puml` to project and used `!include _standard-style.puml`

   - **GitHub Pages not showing updated screenshot**:
     - Cause: docs workflow only triggers on `main` branch, changes were on `develop`
     - Fix: Merged develop to main to trigger docs deployment

5. Problem Solving:
   - Consolidated 6 documentation files into 3 (index.md, getting-started.md, reference.md)
   - Explained AWS IAM permissions issue on corporate Coder machine (Karpenter node role lacks deployment permissions)
   - Fixed PlantUML syntax errors by avoiding dots in component names and using rectangle syntax

6. All user messages:
   - "The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super concise..."
   - [Screenshot of successful test workflow]
   - "also make sure the documentation explains that we have two GH Action based pipelines..."
   - "why does the published documentation still show the old screenshot (without api fetching)?"
   - "then, where you describe the GH Action pipeline (/workflow) for documentation, it should be made clear that the docu line only runs off the main branch"
   - "also include the screenshot of the deployed documentation in the documentation, incl. the link to this documentation"
   - [Long message about setup.sh failing on corporate cloud machine with IAM permission error]
   - "add a frontend developer documentation which explains the chosen architecture of the ui template (eg. MVI and the associated unidirectional flow of information, Redux and its slices as state management, persistence of user information in the browser, authentication and credentials management / api tokens (access, refresh, ...), logging in the browser's development console via the Logging class, etc. Make it illustrative with plantuml diagrams (/png). Tie this documentation to the main readme and the main published documentation"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Validate fixed PlantUML files (component-hierarchy.puml, logging-system.puml)
   - Generate PNGs from all PlantUML files
   - Create frontend-architecture.md documentation
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to include new documentation
   - Link to main README and published documentation
   - Commit and push changes

8. Current Work:
   Creating frontend architecture documentation with PlantUML diagrams. Created 6 PlantUML files:
   - mvi-data-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - redux-store-structure.puml (validates OK)
   - authentication-token-flow.puml (validates OK)
   - component-hierarchy.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - logging-system.puml (just fixed syntax errors)
   - api-request-flow.puml (validates OK)
   
   Last action was fixing logging-system.puml by replacing component `[...]` syntax with `rectangle "..."` syntax.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Validate the two fixed PlantUML files and generate all PNGs, then create the frontend-architecture.md documentation file.

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: T...
