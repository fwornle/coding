I'm ready to help you search and navigate the codebase. I can help you find files, search code contents, and read specific files efficiently.

What would you like me to search for? Some examples of what I can do:

- Find files matching a pattern (e.g., "Find all TypeScript files in the src directory")
- Search for specific code patterns or text (e.g., "Find all files that use GraphDatabase")
- Read and analyze specific files (e.g., "Show me the KnowledgeRetriever implementation")
- Locate files by name (e.g., "Find the ontology configuration files")

Please let me know what you'd like to explore in this codebase.
