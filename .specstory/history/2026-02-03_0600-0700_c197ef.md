**User Request:** I want to portrait this project in a Medium article, similar to this one: '/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Documents/Coding-like.pdf'. Here are some comments about style for Medium articles:
Here are some style considerations that work well on Medium:
Structure

Keep paragraphs short — 2-4 sentences max. Long blocks of text feel heavy on screen
Use subheadings to break up longer pieces, but don't overdo it
Lead with a hook. Medium shows the first few lines as a preview, so make them count

Tone

Medium readers generally respond to a conversational, first-person voice
Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend, not lecturing
Personal stories and concrete examples tend to resonate more than abstract advice

Length

The sweet spot is often 5-7 minutes reading time (roughly 1,000-1,500 words)
Shorter pieces can work for quick takes; longer for deep dives — just make sure every section earns its place

Formatting choices

Images help, but don't add them just for decoration. Use visuals that actually illustrate your point
Pull quotes can highlight key insights and add visual variety
Code blocks render nicely if you're writing technical content

Headlines

Clear and specific usually beats clever and vague
Numbers and "how to" framing tend to perform well, though this can feel formulaic
Avoid clickbait — Medium's audience is fairly discerning

Editing

Read it aloud before publishing. You'll catch awkward phrasing immediately
Cut ruthlessly. If a sentence doesn't add value, remove it

The most successful Medium posts typically feel like a real person sharing genuine insight rather than content optimized for algorithms. What kind of article are you thinking of writing?
Write an Article to summarize the key aspects of Coding in a publishable form for Medium

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json

```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
