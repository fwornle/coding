**User Request:** Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config? Have all models you listed there '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>-providers.yaml' been the result of a web research to be current? Also, why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase? Or is it necessary to make things work, because we used to call it GROK instead of GROQ for some time? If so, can that not be fixed instedad?

**User Request:** Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config? Have all models you listed there '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>-providers.yaml' been the result of a web research to be current? Also, why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase? Or is it necessary to make things work, because we used to call it GROK instead of GROQ for some time? If so, can that not be fixed instedad?

**User Request:** Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config? Have all models you listed there '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>-providers.yaml' been the result of a web research to be current? Also, why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase? Or is it necessary to make things work, because we used to call it GROK instead of GROQ for some time? If so, can that not be fixed instedad?

**User Request:** Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config? Have all models you listed there '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>-providers.yaml' been the result of a web research to be current? Also, why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase? Or is it necessary to make things work, because we used to call it GROK instead of GROQ for some time? If so, can that not be fixed instedad?

### Task - 2026-02-10 06:51:42 UTC [07:51:42 CEST]

**User Request:** # Documentation Style Guide

Enforce consistent styling for documentation artifacts (PlantUML, Mermaid, markdown, PNG diagrams).

## Instructions

When creating or modifying documentation artifacts, follow these guidelines strictly.

---

## PlantUML Diagrams (.puml)

### File Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: Use kebab-case, descriptive names. NEVER use incremental suffixes.

**Correct**:
- `health-verification-flow.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components.puml`

**WRONG** (constraint violation):
- `health-verification-flow-2.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture-v2.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components-new.puml`

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

---

## PNG Generation

### Generating PNGs from PlantUML

Use the PlantUML JAR or online service:

```bash
# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```
```

### Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive node labels
2. Keep diagrams focused - split large diagrams into multiple
3. Use subgraphs for logical grouping
4. Prefer `graph TD` (top-down) over `graph LR` (left-right) for readability

---

## Markdown Documentation

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `api-quota-checker.md`
- Use `README.md` for directory index files
- Never use spaces or special characters

### Structure

1. Start with H1 title matching the topic
2. Include brief overview paragraph
3. Use H2 for major sections
4. Use H3 for subsections
5. Include code examples where applicable

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal links: `[Status Line](./status-line.md)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links
- Verify links work before committing

---

## Validation Workflow

Before committing documentation changes:

1. **PlantUML**: Verify syntax by generating PNG
2. **Mermaid**: Preview in VS Code or GitHub
3. **Markdown**: Check rendering in preview
4. **Links**: Verify all internal links work
5. **Images**: Ensure referenced images exist

---

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Incremental naming** (`-2`, `-v2`, `-new` suffixes)
2. **Missing style include** in PlantUML
3. **Horizontal-heavy layouts** causing scroll
4. **Orphaned images** (PNG without source PUML)
5. **Broken internal links**
6. **Inconsistent component colors** (not using stereotypes)

---

## Quick Reference

| Artifact | Location | Naming | Style |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| PlantUML | `docs/puml/` | kebab-case.puml | Include `_standard-style.puml` |
| PNG | `docs/images/` | match-source.png | Generated from PUML |
| Markdown | `docs/*/` | kebab-case.md | H1 title, H2 sections |
| Mermaid | Inline | N/A | graph TD preferred |

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

---

## PNG Generation

### Generating PNGs from PlantUML

Use the PlantUML JAR or online service:

```bash
# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```
```

### Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive node labels
2. Keep diagrams focused - split large diagrams into multiple
3. Use subgraphs for logical grouping
4. Prefer `graph TD` (top-down) over `graph LR` (left-right) for readability

---

## Markdown Documentation

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `api-quota-checker.md`
- Use `README.md` for directory index files
- Never use spaces or special characters

### Structure

1. Start with H1 title matching the topic
2. Include brief overview paragraph
3. Use H2 for major sections
4. Use H3 for subsections
5. Include code examples where applicable

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal links: `[Status Line](./status-line.md)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links
- Verify links work before committing

---

## Validation Workflow

Before committing documentation changes:

1. **PlantUML**: Verify syntax by generating PNG
2. **Mermaid**: Preview in VS Code or GitHub
3. **Markdown**: Check rendering in preview
4. **Links**: Verify all internal links work
5. **Images**: Ensure referenced images exist

---

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Incremental naming** (`-2`, `-v2`, `-new` suffixes)
2. **Missing style include** in PlantUML
3. **Horizontal-heavy layouts** causing scroll
4. **Orphaned images** (PNG without source PUML)
5. **Broken internal links**
6. **Inconsistent component colors** (not using stereotypes)

---

## Quick Reference

| Artifact | Location | Naming | Style |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| PlantUML | `docs/puml/` | kebab-case.puml | Include `_standard-style.puml` |
| PNG | `docs/images/` | match-source.png | Generated from PUML |
| Markdown | `docs/*/` | kebab-case.md | H1 title, H2 sections |
| Mermaid | Inline | N/A | graph TD preferred |

**Tool:** EnterPlanMode
**Input:** ```json
{}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
Entered plan mode. You should now focus on exploring the codebase and designing an implementation approach.

In plan mode, you should:
1. Thoroughly explore the codebase to understand existing patterns
2. Identify similar features and architectural approaches
3. Consider multiple approaches and their trade-offs
4. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify the approach
5. Design a concrete implementation strategy
6. When ready, use ExitPlanMode to present your plan for approval

Remember: DO NOT

**User Request:** # Documentation Style Guide

Enforce consistent styling for documentation artifacts (PlantUML, Mermaid, markdown, PNG diagrams).

## Instructions

When creating or modifying documentation artifacts, follow these guidelines strictly.

---

## PlantUML Diagrams (.puml)

### File Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: Use kebab-case, descriptive names. NEVER use incremental suffixes.

**Correct**:
- `health-verification-flow.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components.puml`

**WRONG** (constraint violation):
- `health-verification-flow-2.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture-v2.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components-new.puml`

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow

- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```
```

### Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive node labels
2. Keep diagrams focused - split large diagrams into multiple
3. Use subgraphs for logical grouping
4. Prefer `graph TD` (top-down) over `graph LR` (left-right) for readability

---

## Markdown Documentation

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `api-quota-checker.md`
- Use `README.md` for directory index files
- Never use spaces or special characters

### Structure

1. Start with H1 title matching the topic
2. Include brief overview paragraph
3. Use H2 for major sections
4. Use H3 for subsections
5. Include code examples where applicable

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal links: `[Status Line](./status-line.md)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links
- Verify links work before committing

---

## Validation Workflow

Before committing documentation changes:

1. **PlantUML**: Verify syntax by generating PNG
2. **Mermaid**: Preview in VS Code or GitHub
3. **Markdown**: Check rendering in preview
4. **Links**: Verify all internal links work
5. **Images**: Ensure referenced images exist

---

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Incremental naming** (`-2`, `-v2`, `-new` suffixes)
2. **Missing style include** in PlantUML
3. **Horizontal-heavy layouts** causing scroll
4. **Orphaned images** (PNG without source PUML)
5. **Broken internal links**
6. **Inconsistent component colors** (not using stereotypes)

---

**User Request:** # Documentation Style Guide

Enforce consistent styling for documentation artifacts (PlantUML, Mermaid, markdown, PNG diagrams).

## Instructions

When creating or modifying documentation artifacts, follow these guidelines strictly.

---

## PlantUML Diagrams (.puml)

### File Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: Use kebab-case, descriptive names. NEVER use incremental suffixes.

**Correct**:
- `health-verification-flow.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components.puml`

**WRONG** (constraint violation):
- `health-verification-flow-2.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture-v2.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components-new.puml`

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

---

## PNG Generation

### Generating PNGs from PlantUML

Use the PlantUML JAR or online service:

```bash
# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation is a continuation from a previous session that implemented a "Unified LLM Support Layer" (`lib/llm/`). Phases 1-4 were completed in the previous session. The summary indicates:
   - Phase 1: Built lib/llm/ standalone library (22 files)
   - Phase 2: Migrated SemanticValidator (465 → 247 lines)
   - Phase 3: Migrated UnifiedInferenceEngine (771 → 195 lines)
   - Phase 4: Migrated SemanticAnalyzer (2024 → 1103 lines)
   - Phase 5: Pending (Cleanup & Docker)

2. **Phase 5 Work**: The assistant continued with Phase 5:
   - Updated task statuses
   - Read files needing GROK→GROQ migration: groq-engine.js, config-manager.js, .env.example
   - Fixed GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY in all files
   - Updated config-manager.js to use 'groq' instead of 'grok' config key
   - Fixed import paths from `lib/llm/index.js` to `lib/llm/dist/index.js` (since TypeScript outputs to dist/)
   - Updated Dockerfile with lib/llm install and build steps
   - Built lib/llm locally, verified TypeScript compilation

3. **User Request for Commit**: User said "commit this" and then asked several questions about model currency:
   - Are Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.5 candidates for config?
   - Were models web-researched to be current?
   - Why does groq have apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can GROK backward compat be eliminated?

4. **Model Updates**: Based on web research, the assistant:
   - Updated ALL model IDs across the codebase to current (Feb 2026) versions
   - Removed GROK_API_KEY backward compat entirely from types.ts, groq-provider.ts, config.ts, llm-providers.yaml
   - Updated Anthropic models: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-opus-4-6
   - Updated Gemini models: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro (gemini-2.0-flash-exp deprecated March 2026)
   - Updated OpenAI models: gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1, o4-mini
   - Updated Groq: added openai/gpt-oss-120b as premium tier
   - Updated GitHub Models to match OpenAI's current models
   - Updated per-operation routing maps in SemanticValidator and UnifiedInferenceEngine
   - Rebuilt lib/llm, verified TypeScript compilation
   - Created commit: `712c8abe feat: add unified LLM support layer (lib/llm/) and migrate consumers`

5. **User did git work themselves** and then asked for comprehensive documentation updates:
   - "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer"
   - "Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect"
   - "ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs"
   - "Update all related puml/png's"
   - "Also update the MkDocs"

6. **Documentation Style Skill** was invoked, providing PlantUML naming conventions, style includes, stereotypes, arrow macros, and validation workflow.

7. **Exploration Phase**: Two exploration agents were launched in parallel:
   - Agent 1: Read all 10 LLM-related documentation files, found outdated model names, GROK_API_KEY references, inconsistent provider chain descriptions
   - Agent 2: Explored docs-content/, PUML files, PNG files, standard style file

8. **Plan Mode**: The assistant entered plan mode and read key files:
   - docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md (407 lines) - Has outdated models (mixtral, claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-haiku, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), wrong cost tables
   - docs/provider-configuration.md (293 lines) - Has GROK_API_KEY on line 23 and 119, outdated references
   - docs/puml/_standard-style.puml (92 lines) - Standard styling for all diagrams
   - docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md (192 lines) - Mentions "3-tier LLM chain"
   - docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md (178 lines) - No semantic validation section
   - mkdocs.yml (117 lines) - Navigation structure, needs new "LLM Architecture" entry potentially

Key files with outdated content identified:
- docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md: Old models (mixtral, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-haiku-20240307, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), old cost table (Anthropic Claude 3.5, OpenAI GPT-4o), no mention of lib/llm/ unified layer, no GitHub Models provider, no tier-based routing
- docs/provider-configuration.md: GROK_API_KEY (lines 23, 119), old 5-provider chain, no lib/llm/ reference, no tier routing
- SA README.md: "6-Tier LLM Provider Chain" is outdated (was Groq→Gemini→Custom→Anthropic→OpenAI→Ollama), should reflect new lib/llm/ architecture
- SA installation docs: Outdated models (gemini-2.0-flash-exp, claude-sonnet-4-20250514, gpt-4)
- SA architecture docs: Old "5-tier provider chain" references
- SA agents.md: Old provider chain references per agent
- Constraint monitor semantic-constraint-detection.md: claude-3-haiku-20240307, GROK_API_KEY
- Constraint monitor semantic-detection-design.md: claude-3-haiku-20240307, gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o-mini

No existing PUML files for LLM architecture were found - only _standard-style.puml exists. New architecture diagrams need to be created.

The user's request was very comprehensive - update ALL docs, create architecture diagrams, update all PUML/PNG, update MkDocs. The assistant was in the middle of plan mode Phase 2 (Design) when this summary was requested.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:

   **Original request (from previous session)**: Implement a detailed plan for a "Unified LLM Support Layer" (`lib/llm/`) consolidating 3 separate LLM abstractions into a shared library with 5 phases and 26 implementation steps.

   **This session's initial work**: Continue Phase 5 (Cleanup & Docker updates) - GROK→GROQ migration, Docker build updates, import path fixes.

   **User feedback on commit**: Before committing, the user asked:
   - "Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config?"
   - "Have all models you listed been the result of a web research to be current?"
   - "Why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase?"
   
   This led to web research and updating ALL model IDs to current (Feb 2026) versions and removing GROK backward compat entirely.

   **Current request (most recent)**: User said: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Unified LLM Support Layer** (`lib/llm/`): New shared library with 8 providers, tier-based routing, circuit breaker, LRU cache
   - **Tier-based routing**: fast/standard/premium model tiers with provider priority chains
   - **8 Providers**: Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, GitHub Models, DMR, Ollama, Mock
   - **Current model IDs (Feb 2026)**: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-opus-4-6, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1, o4-mini, llama-3.3-70b-versatile, openai/gpt-oss-120b
   - **Dependency Injection**: MockServiceInterface, BudgetTrackerInterface, SensitivityClassifierInterface
   - **Mode routing**: mock/local/public LLM modes via setModeResolver()
   - **PlantUML documentation style**: Must include `_standard-style.puml`, use kebab-case, use stereotypes for coloring
   - **MkDocs**: Site at docs-content/ directory, Material theme, nav structure in mkdocs.yml

3. Files and Code Sections:

   **Files CREATED in lib/llm/ (Phase 1, previous session)**:

   - `docker/Dockerfile.coding-services` - Added lib/llm npm install and tsc build steps

   **Documentation files READ (for planning doc updates)**:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` (407 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Contains outdated models (mixtral-8x7b, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-haiku-20240307, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), old cost table, no mention of lib/llm/ or tier routing, no GitHub Models provider
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` (293 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Has GROK_API_KEY on lines 23 and 119, old 5-provider chain, no lib/llm/ reference
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` (192 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Says "3-tier LLM chain", doesn't mention lib/llm/
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` (178 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: No semantic validation section mentioning LLM
   - `mkdocs.yml` (117 lines) - Nav structure, may need new architecture entry for LLM layer
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` (92 lines) - Standard PlantUML styling for all diagrams
   - Various integration README.md and docs files with outdated provider chains and model names

   **Key outdated content found across docs**:
   - Provider chain described as "Groq → Gemini → Custom LLM → Anthropic → OpenAI → Ollama" (old 6-tier)
   - Should now be tier-based: fast tier (Groq), standard tier (Groq→Anthropic→OpenAI), premium tier (Anthropic→OpenAI→Groq)
   - Old model names: claude-3-haiku-20240307, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, qwen-2.5-32b-instruct
   - GROK_API_KEY references in docs/provider-configuration.md and constraint-monitor docs
   - No architecture diagrams exist for LLM layer (no PUML files besides _standard-style.puml)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Bash output suppression**: Throughout session, bash commands frequently returned empty output. Workaround: write to temp files and read with Read tool.
   - **Grep not finding GROK_API_KEY**: Despite files clearly containing it, Grep returned no matches. Likely a .gitignore or submodule issue. Fixed by reading files directly and using Edit tool.
   - **Import path mismatch**: Consumers imported from `lib/llm/index.js` but TypeScript outputs to `lib/llm/dist/`. Fixed by updating all import paths to `lib/llm/dist/index.js`.
   - **Temp file staged**: `lib/llm/tsc-check-result.txt` was accidentally staged. Fixed with `git rm --cached`.
   - **Submodule dirty state**: Submodules showed as dirty after parent commit. User handled git themselves.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully completed all 5 phases of the Unified LLM Support Layer implementation
   - Web-researched current model IDs from Groq, Anthropic, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, OpenAI, GitHub Models documentation
   - Eliminated GROK_API_KEY backward compat entirely from codebase
   - Updated all model IDs to current Feb 2026 versions
   - Identified comprehensive list of documentation files needing updates

6. All user messages:
   - "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. [detailed summary of previous work]"
   - "commit this" + "/login" command + questions: "Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config? Have all models you listed there '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>-providers.yaml' been the result of a web research to be current? Also, why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase? Or is it necessary to make things work, because we used to call it GROK instead of GROQ for some time? If so, can that not be fixed instead?"
   - [User interrupted tool use during submodule git work] "I have done the git stuff myself. Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Documentation update (current work)**: Update ALL documentation files mentioning LLM usage across the entire codebase
   - **Create architecture diagrams**: New PlantUML diagrams for lib/llm/ architecture (providers, tier routing, circuit breaker flow)
   - **Update existing diagrams**: Update any PNG/PUML references to old provider chains
   - **Update MkDocs**: Potentially add new navigation entry for LLM architecture
   - **Update integration docs**: SA README, installation guide, architecture docs, agents.md, constraint monitor docs
   - **Update root docs**: provider-configuration.md, docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md
   - **Fix GROK_API_KEY references in docs**: provider-configuration.md lines 23/119, constraint detection docs

8. Current Work:
   The assistant was in **Plan Mode Phase 1-2** (exploration and design) for the comprehensive documentation update task. The documentation-style skill was loaded. Two exploration agents completed thorough analysis of all documentation files. Key files were read directly:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` - full 407 lines
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` - full 293 lines  
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` - full 92 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - full 192 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - full 178 lines
   - `mkdocs.yml` - full 117 lines
   
   The plan file at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/plans/cached-growing-goose.md` still contains the OLD implementation plan (for lib/llm/ code). It needs to be overwritten with the new documentation update plan. The assistant had not yet written the new plan or called ExitPlanMode.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Write the documentation update plan to the plan file and call ExitPlanMode. The plan should cover:
   
   1. Create new PlantUML architecture diagrams for lib/llm/ (e.g., `docs/puml/llm-provider-architecture.puml`, `docs/puml/llm-tier-routing.puml`)
   2. Generate PNGs from the PUML files
   3. Update `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` with new architecture, current models, tier-based routing, lib/llm/ reference, GitHub Models provider, updated cost table
   4. Update `docs/provider-configuration.md` - fix GROK_API_KEY, add lib/llm/ reference, update provider chain
   5. Update `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - mention lib/llm/ delegation
   6. Update `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - add semantic validation section
   7. Update SA README.md and sub-docs (installation, architecture, agents) with new provider chain and model names
   8. Update constraint monitor docs (semantic-constraint-detection.md, semantic-detection-design.md) with current models
   9. Potentially update mkdocs.yml nav with new architecture section for LLM layer
   
   User's exact request: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

   - `docker/Dockerfile.coding-services` - Added lib/llm npm install and tsc build steps

   **Documentation files READ (for planning doc updates)**:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` (407 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Contains outdated models (mixtral-8x7b, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-haiku-20240307, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), old cost table, no mention of lib/llm/ or tier routing, no GitHub Models provider
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` (293 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Has GROK_API_KEY on lines 23 and 119, old 5-provider chain, no lib/llm/ reference
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` (192 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Says "3-tier LLM chain", doesn't mention lib/llm/
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` (178 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: No semantic validation section mentioning LLM
   - `mkdocs.yml` (117 lines) - Nav structure, may need new architecture entry for LLM layer
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` (92 lines) - Standard PlantUML styling for all diagrams
   - Various integration README.md and docs files with outdated provider chains and model names

   **Key outdated content found across docs**:
   - Provider chain described as "Groq → Gemini → Custom LLM → Anthropic → OpenAI → Ollama" (old 6-tier)
   - Should now be tier-based: fast tier (Groq), standard tier (Groq→Anthropic→OpenAI), premium tier (Anthropic→OpenAI→Groq)
   - Old model names: claude-3-haiku-20240307, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, qwen-2.5-32b-instruct
   - GROK_API_KEY references in docs/provider-configuration.md and constraint-monitor docs
   - No architecture diagrams exist for LLM layer (no PUML files besides _standard-style.puml)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Bash output suppression**: Throughout session, bash commands frequently returned empty output. Workaround: write to temp files and read with Read tool.
   - **Grep not finding GROK_API_KEY**: Despite files clearly containing it, Grep returned no matches. Likely a .gitignore or submodule issue. Fixed by reading files directly and using Edit tool.
   - **Import path mismatch**: Consumers imported from `lib/llm/index.js` but TypeScript outputs to `lib/llm/dist/`. Fixed by updating all import paths to `lib/llm/dist/index.js`.
   - **Temp file staged**: `lib/llm/tsc-check-result.txt` was accidentally staged. Fixed with `git rm --cached`.
   - **Submodule dirty state**: Submodules showed as dirty after parent commit. User handled git themselves.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully completed all 5 phases of the Unified LLM Support Layer implementation
   - Web-researched current model IDs from Groq, Anthropic, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, OpenAI, GitHub Models documentation
   - Eliminated GROK_API_KEY backward compat entirely from codebase
   - Updated all model IDs to current Feb 2026 versions
   - Identified comprehensive list of documentation files needing updates

6. All user messages:
   - "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. [detailed summary of previous work]"
   - "commit this" + "/login" command + questions: "Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config? Have all models you listed there '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>-providers.yaml' been the result of a web research to be current? Also, why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase? Or is it necessary to make things work, because we used to call it GROK instead of GROQ for some time? If so, can that not be fixed instead?"
   - [User interrupted tool use during submodule git work] "I have done the git stuff myself. Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Documentation update (current work)**: Update ALL documentation files mentioning LLM usage across the entire codebase
   - **Create architecture diagrams**: New PlantUML diagrams for lib/llm/ architecture (providers, tier routing, circuit breaker flow)
   - **Update existing diagrams**: Update any PNG/PUML references to old provider chains
   - **Update MkDocs**: Potentially add new navigation entry for LLM architecture
   - **Update integration docs**: SA README, installation guide, architecture docs, agents.md, constraint monitor docs
   - **Update root docs**: provider-configuration.md, docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md
   - **Fix GROK_API_KEY references in docs**: provider-configuration.md lines 23/119, constraint detection docs

8. Current Work:
   The assistant was in **Plan Mode Phase 1-2** (exploration and design) for the comprehensive documentation update task. The documentation-style skill was loaded. Two exploration agents completed thorough analysis of all documentation files. Key files were read directly:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` - full 407 lines
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` - full 293 lines  
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` - full 92 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - full 192 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - full 178 lines
   - `mkdocs.yml` - full 117 lines
   
   The plan file at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/plans/cached-growing-goose.md` still contains the OLD implementation plan (for lib/llm/ code). It needs to be overwritten with the new documentation update plan. The assistant had not yet written the new plan or called ExitPlanMode.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Write the documentation update plan to the plan file and call ExitPlanMode. The plan should cover:
   
   1. Create new PlantUML architecture diagrams for lib/llm/ (e.g., `docs/puml/llm-provider-architecture.puml`, `docs/puml/llm-tier-routing.puml`)
   2. Generate PNGs from the PUML files
   3. Update `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` with new architecture, current models, tier-based routing, lib/llm/ reference, GitHub Models provider, updated cost table
   4. Update `docs/provider-configuration.md` - fix GROK_API_KEY, add lib/llm/ reference, update provider chain
   5. Update `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - mention lib/llm/ delegation
   6. Update `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - add semantic validation section
   7. Update SA README.md and sub-docs (installation, architecture, agents) with new provider chain and model names
   8. Update constraint monitor docs (semantic-constraint-detection.md, semantic-detection-design.md) with current models
   9. Potentially update mkdocs.yml nav with new architecture section for LLM layer
   
   User's exact request: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

### Task - 2026-02-10 06:58:26 UTC [07:58:26 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the entire conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation is a continuation from a previous session that implemented a "Unified LLM Support Layer" (`lib/llm/`). Phases 1-4 were completed in the previous session. The summary indicates:
   - Phase 1: Built lib/llm/ standalone library (22 files)
   - Phase 2: Migrated SemanticValidator (465 → 247 lines)
   - Phase 3: Migrated UnifiedInferenceEngine (771 → 195 lines)
   - Phase 4: Migrated SemanticAnalyzer (2024 → 1103 lines)
   - Phase 5: Pending (Cleanup & Docker)

2. **Phase 5 Work**: The assistant continued with Phase 5:
   - Updated task statuses
   - Read files needing GROK→GROQ migration: groq-engine.js, config-manager.js, .env.example
   - Fixed GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY in all files
   - Updated config-manager.js to use 'groq' instead of 'grok' config key
   - Fixed import paths from `lib/llm/index.js` to `lib/llm/dist/index.js` (since TypeScript outputs to dist/)
   - Updated Dockerfile with lib/llm install and build steps
   - Built lib/llm locally, verified TypeScript compilation

3. **User Request for Commit**: User said "commit this" and then asked several questions about model currency:
   - Are Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.5 candidates for config?
   - Were models web-researched to be current?
   - Why does groq have apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can GROK backward compat be eliminated?

4. **Model Updates**: Based on web research, the assistant:
   - Updated ALL model IDs across the codebase to current (Feb 2026) versions
   - Removed GROK_API_KEY backward compat entirely from types.ts, groq-provider.ts, config.ts, llm-providers.yaml
   - Updated Anthropic models: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-opus-4-6
   - Updated Gemini models: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro (gemini-2.0-flash-exp deprecated March 2026)
   - Updated OpenAI models: gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1, o4-mini
   - Updated Groq: added openai/gpt-oss-120b as premium tier
   - Updated GitHub Models to match OpenAI's current models
   - Updated per-operation routing maps in SemanticValidator and UnifiedInferenceEngine
   - Rebuilt lib/llm, verified TypeScript compilation
   - Created commit: `712c8abe feat: add unified LLM support layer (lib/llm/) and migrate consumers`

5. **User did git work themselves** and then asked for comprehensive documentation updates:
   - "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer"
   - "Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect"
   - "ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs"
   - "Update all related puml/png's"
   - "Also update the MkDocs"

6. **Documentation Style Skill** was invoked, providing PlantUML naming conventions, style includes, stereotypes, arrow macros, and validation workflow.

7. **Exploration Phase**: Two exploration agents were launched in parallel:
   - Agent 1: Read all 10 LLM-related documentation files, found outdated model names, GROK_API_KEY references, inconsistent provider chain descriptions
   - Agent 2: Explored docs-content/, PUML files, PNG files, standard style file

8. **Plan Mode**: The assistant entered plan mode and read key files:
   - docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md (407 lines) - Has outdated models (mixtral, claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-haiku, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), wrong cost tables
   - docs/provider-configuration.md (293 lines) - Has GROK_API_KEY on line 23 and 119, outdated references
   - docs/puml/_standard-style.puml (92 lines) - Standard styling for all diagrams
   - docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md (192 lines) - Mentions "3-tier LLM chain"
   - docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md (178 lines) - No semantic validation section
   - mkdocs.yml (117 lines) - Navigation structure, needs new "LLM Architecture" entry potentially

Key files with outdated content identified:
- docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md: Old models (mixtral, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-haiku-20240307, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), old cost table (Anthropic Claude 3.5, OpenAI GPT-4o), no mention of lib/llm/ unified layer, no GitHub Models provider, no tier-based routing
- docs/provider-configuration.md: GROK_API_KEY (lines 23, 119), old 5-provider chain, no lib/llm/ reference, no tier routing
- SA README.md: "6-Tier LLM Provider Chain" is outdated (was Groq→Gemini→Custom→Anthropic→OpenAI→Ollama), should reflect new lib/llm/ architecture
- SA installation docs: Outdated models (gemini-2.0-flash-exp, claude-sonnet-4-20250514, gpt-4)
- SA architecture docs: Old "5-tier provider chain" references
- SA agents.md: Old provider chain references per agent
- Constraint monitor semantic-constraint-detection.md: claude-3-haiku-20240307, GROK_API_KEY
- Constraint monitor semantic-detection-design.md: claude-3-haiku-20240307, gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o-mini

No existing PUML files for LLM architecture were found - only _standard-style.puml exists. New architecture diagrams need to be created.

The user's request was very comprehensive - update ALL docs, create architecture diagrams, update all PUML/PNG, update MkDocs. The assistant was in the middle of plan mode Phase 2 (Design) when this summary was requested.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:

   **Original request (from previous session)**: Implement a detailed plan for a "Unified LLM Support Layer" (`lib/llm/`) consolidating 3 separate LLM abstractions into a shared library with 5 phases and 26 implementation steps.

   **This session's initial work**: Continue Phase 5 (Cleanup & Docker updates) - GROK→GROQ migration, Docker build updates, import path fixes.

   **User feedback on commit**: Before committing, the user asked:
   - "Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config?"
   - "Have all models you listed been the result of a web research to be current?"
   - "Why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase?"
   
   This led to web research and updating ALL model IDs to current (Feb 2026) versions and removing GROK backward compat entirely.

   **Current request (most recent)**: User said: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Unified LLM Support Layer** (`lib/llm/`): New shared library with 8 providers, tier-based routing, circuit breaker, LRU cache
   - **Tier-based routing**: fast/standard/premium model tiers with provider priority chains
   - **8 Providers**: Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, GitHub Models, DMR, Ollama, Mock
   - **Current model IDs (Feb 2026)**: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-opus-4-6, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1, o4-mini, llama-3.3-70b-versatile, openai/gpt-oss-120b
   - **Dependency Injection**: MockServiceInterface, BudgetTrackerInterface, SensitivityClassifierInterface
   - **Mode routing**: mock/local/public LLM modes via setModeResolver()
   - **PlantUML documentation style**: Must include `_standard-style.puml`, use kebab-case, use stereotypes for coloring
   - **MkDocs**: Site at docs-content/ directory, Material theme, nav structure in mkdocs.yml

3. Files and Code Sections:

   **Files CREATED in lib/llm/ (Phase 1, previous session)**:

   - **Documentation update (current work)**: Update ALL documentation files mentioning LLM usage across the entire codebase
   - **Create architecture diagrams**: New PlantUML diagrams for lib/llm/ architecture (providers, tier routing, circuit breaker flow)
   - **Update existing diagrams**: Update any PNG/PUML references to old provider chains
   - **Update MkDocs**: Potentially add new navigation entry for LLM architecture
   - **Update integration docs**: SA README, installation guide, architecture docs, agents.md, constraint monitor docs
   - **Update root docs**: provider-configuration.md, docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md
   - **Fix GROK_API_KEY references in docs**: provider-configuration.md lines 23/119, constraint detection docs

8. Current Work:
   The assistant was in **Plan Mode Phase 1-2** (exploration and design) for the comprehensive documentation update task. The documentation-style skill was loaded. Two exploration agents completed thorough analysis of all documentation files. Key files were read directly:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` - full 407 lines
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` - full 293 lines  
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` - full 92 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - full 192 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - full 178 lines
   - `mkdocs.yml` - full 117 lines
   
   The plan file at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/plans/cached-growing-goose.md` still contains the OLD implementation plan (for lib/llm/ code). It needs to be overwritten with the new documentation update plan. The assistant had not yet written the new plan or called ExitPlanMode.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Write the documentation update plan to the plan file and call ExitPlanMode. The plan should cover:
   
   1. Create new PlantUML architecture diagrams for lib/llm/ (e.g., `docs/puml/llm-provider-architecture.puml`, `docs/puml/llm-tier-routing.puml`)
   2. Generate PNGs from the PUML files
   3. Update `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` with new architecture, current models, tier-based routing, lib/llm/ reference, GitHub Models provider, updated cost table
   4. Update `docs/provider-configuration.md` - fix GROK_API_KEY, add lib/llm/ reference, update provider chain
   5. Update `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - mention lib/llm/ delegation
   6. Update `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - add semantic validation section
   7. Update SA README.md and sub-docs (installation, architecture, agents) with new provider chain and model names
   8. Update constraint monitor docs (semantic-constraint-detection.md, semantic-detection-design.md) with current models
   9. Potentially update mkdocs.yml nav with new architecture section for LLM layer
   
   User's exact request: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-coding/e432c4c9-6d4d-462e-aaf5-130cf75ff2ec.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Task" id="toolu_01XasPnJWZmKjkrnR94t3L3c - 2026-02-10 06:58:26 UTC [07:58:26 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the entire conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation is a continuation from a previous session that implemented a "Unified LLM Support Layer" (`lib/llm/`). Phases 1-4 were completed in the previous session. The summary indicates:
   - Phase 1: Built lib/llm/ standalone library (22 files)
   - Phase 2: Migrated SemanticValidator (465 → 247 lines)
   - Phase 3: Migrated UnifiedInferenceEngine (771 → 195 lines)
   - Phase 4: Migrated SemanticAnalyzer (2024 → 1103 lines)
   - Phase 5: Pending (Cleanup & Docker)

2. **Phase 5 Work**: The assistant continued with Phase 5:
   - Updated task statuses
   - Read files needing GROK→GROQ migration: groq-engine.js, config-manager.js, .env.example
   - Fixed GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY in all files
   - Updated config-manager.js to use 'groq' instead of 'grok' config key
   - Fixed import paths from `lib/llm/index.js` to `lib/llm/dist/index.js` (since TypeScript outputs to dist/)
   - Updated Dockerfile with lib/llm install and build steps
   - Built lib/llm locally, verified TypeScript compilation

3. **User Request for Commit**: User said "commit this" and then asked several questions about model currency:
   - Are Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.5 candidates for config?
   - Were models web-researched to be current?
   - Why does groq have apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can GROK backward compat be eliminated?

4. **Model Updates**: Based on web research, the assistant:
   - Updated ALL model IDs across the codebase to current (Feb 2026) versions
   - Removed GROK_API_KEY backward compat entirely from types.ts, groq-provider.ts, config.ts, llm-providers.yaml
   - Updated Anthropic models: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-opus-4-6
   - Updated Gemini models: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro (gemini-2.0-flash-exp deprecated March 2026)
   - Updated OpenAI models: gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1, o4-mini
   - Updated Groq: added openai/gpt-oss-120b as premium tier
   - Updated GitHub Models to match OpenAI's current models
   - Updated per-operation routing maps in SemanticValidator and UnifiedInferenceEngine
   - Rebuilt lib/llm, verified TypeScript compilation
   - Created commit: `712c8abe feat: add unified LLM support layer (lib/llm/) and migrate consumers`

5. **User did git work themselves** and then asked for comprehensive documentation updates:
   - "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer"
   - "Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect"
   - "ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs"
   - "Update all related puml/png's"
   - "Also update the MkDocs"

6. **Documentation Style Skill** was invoked, providing PlantUML naming conventions, style includes, stereotypes, arrow macros, and validation workflow.

7. **Exploration Phase**: Two exploration agents were launched in parallel:
   - Agent 1: Read all 10 LLM-related documentation files, found outdated model names, GROK_API_KEY references, inconsistent provider chain descriptions
   - Agent 2: Explored docs-content/, PUML files, PNG files, standard style file

8. **Plan Mode**: The assistant entered plan mode and read key files:
   - docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md (407 lines) - Has outdated models (mixtral, claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-haiku, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), wrong cost tables
   - docs/provider-configuration.md (293 lines) - Has GROK_API_KEY on line 23 and 119, outdated references
   - docs/puml/_standard-style.puml (92 lines) - Standard styling for all diagrams
   - docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md (192 lines) - Mentions "3-tier LLM chain"
   - docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md (178 lines) - No semantic validation section
   - mkdocs.yml (117 lines) - Navigation structure, needs new "LLM Architecture" entry potentially

Key files with outdated content identified:
- docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md: Old models (mixtral, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-haiku-20240307, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), old cost table (Anthropic Claude 3.5, OpenAI GPT-4o), no mention of lib/llm/ unified layer, no GitHub Models provider, no tier-based routing
- docs/provider-configuration.md: GROK_API_KEY (lines 23, 119), old 5-provider chain, no lib/llm/ reference, no tier routing
- SA README.md: "6-Tier LLM Provider Chain" is outdated (was Groq→Gemini→Custom→Anthropic→OpenAI→Ollama), should reflect new lib/llm/ architecture
- SA installation docs: Outdated models (gemini-2.0-flash-exp, claude-sonnet-4-20250514, gpt-4)
- SA architecture docs: Old "5-tier provider chain" references
- SA agents.md: Old provider chain references per agent
- Constraint monitor semantic-constraint-detection.md: claude-3-haiku-20240307, GROK_API_KEY
- Constraint monitor semantic-detection-design.md: claude-3-haiku-20240307, gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o-mini

No existing PUML files for LLM architecture were found - only _standard-style.puml exists. New architecture diagrams need to be created.

The user's request was very comprehensive - update ALL docs, create architecture diagrams, update all PUML/PNG, update MkDocs. The assistant was in the middle of plan mode Phase 2 (Design) when this summary was requested.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:

   **Original request (from previous session)**: Implement a detailed plan for a "Unified LLM Support Layer" (`lib/llm/`) consolidating 3 separate LLM abstractions into a shared library with 5 phases and 26 implementation steps.

   **This session's initial work**: Continue Phase 5 (Cleanup & Docker updates) - GROK→GROQ migration, Docker build updates, import path fixes.

   **User feedback on commit**: Before committing, the user asked:
   - "Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config?"
   - "Have all models you listed been the result of a web research to be current?"
   - "Why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase?"
   
   This led to web research and updating ALL model IDs to current (Feb 2026) versions and removing GROK backward compat entirely.

   **Current request (most recent)**: User said: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Unified LLM Support Layer** (`lib/llm/`): New shared library with 8 providers, tier-based routing, circuit breaker, LRU cache
   - **Tier-based routing**: fast/standard/premium model tiers with provider priority chains
   - **8 Providers**: Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, GitHub Models, DMR, Ollama, Mock
   - **Current model IDs (Feb 2026)**: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-opus-4-6, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1, o4-mini, llama-3.3-70b-versatile, openai/gpt-oss-120b
   - **Dependency Injection**: MockServiceInterface, BudgetTrackerInterface, SensitivityClassifierInterface
   - **Mode routing**: mock/local/public LLM modes via setModeResolver()
   - **PlantUML documentation style**: Must include `_standard-style.puml`, use kebab-case, use stereotypes for coloring
   - **MkDocs**: Site at docs-content/ directory, Material theme, nav structure in mkdocs.yml

3. Files and Code Sections:

   **Files CREATED in lib/llm/ (Phase 1, previous session)**:
   - `lib/llm/package.json` - Package with optional SDK deps
   - `lib/llm/tsconfig.json` - ES2022, ESNext module, strict, outDir: ./dist

   - `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/.env.example` - GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY
   - `docker/Dockerfile.coding-services` - Added lib/llm npm install and tsc build steps

   **Documentation files READ (for planning doc updates)**:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` (407 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Contains outdated models (mixtral-8x7b, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-haiku-20240307, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), old cost table, no mention of lib/llm/ or tier routing, no GitHub Models provider
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` (293 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Has GROK_API_KEY on lines 23 and 119, old 5-provider chain, no lib/llm/ reference
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` (192 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Says "3-tier LLM chain", doesn't mention lib/llm/
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` (178 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: No semantic validation section mentioning LLM
   - `mkdocs.yml` (117 lines) - Nav structure, may need new architecture entry for LLM layer
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` (92 lines) - Standard PlantUML styling for all diagrams
   - Various integration README.md and docs files with outdated provider chains and model names

   **Key outdated content found across docs**:
   - Provider chain described as "Groq → Gemini → Custom LLM → Anthropic → OpenAI → Ollama" (old 6-tier)
   - Should now be tier-based: fast tier (Groq), standard tier (Groq→Anthropic→OpenAI), premium tier (Anthropic→OpenAI→Groq)
   - Old model names: claude-3-haiku-20240307, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, qwen-2.5-32b-instruct
   - GROK_API_KEY references in docs/provider-configuration.md and constraint-monitor docs
   - No architecture diagrams exist for LLM layer (no PUML files besides _standard-style.puml)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Bash output suppression**: Throughout session, bash commands frequently returned empty output. Workaround: write to temp files and read with Read tool.
   - **Grep not finding GROK_API_KEY**: Despite files clearly containing it, Grep returned no matches. Likely a .gitignore or submodule issue. Fixed by reading files directly and using Edit tool.
   - **Import path mismatch**: Consumers imported from `lib/llm/index.js` but TypeScript outputs to `lib/llm/dist/`. Fixed by updating all import paths to `lib/llm/dist/index.js`.
   - **Temp file staged**: `lib/llm/tsc-check-result.txt` was accidentally staged. Fixed with `git rm --cached`.
   - **Submodule dirty state**: Submodules showed as dirty after parent commit. User handled git themselves.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully completed all 5 phases of the Unified LLM Support Layer implementation
   - Web-researched current model IDs from Groq, Anthropic, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, OpenAI, GitHub Models documentation
   - Eliminated GROK_API_KEY backward compat entirely from codebase
   - Updated all model IDs to current Feb 2026 versions
   - Identified comprehensive list of documentation files needing updates

6. All user messages:
   - "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. [detailed summary of previous work]"
   - "commit this" + "/login" command + questions: "Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config? Have all models you listed there '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>-providers.yaml' been the result of a web research to be current? Also, why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase? Or is it necessary to make things work, because we used to call it GROK instead of GROQ for some time? If so, can that not be fixed instead?"
   - [User interrupted tool use during submodule git work] "I have done the git stuff myself. Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Documentation update (current work)**: Update ALL documentation files mentioning LLM usage across the entire codebase
   - **Create architecture diagrams**: New PlantUML diagrams for lib/llm/ architecture (providers, tier routing, circuit breaker flow)
   - **Update existing diagrams**: Update any PNG/PUML references to old provider chains
   - **Update MkDocs**: Potentially add new navigation entry for LLM architecture
   - **Update integration docs**: SA README, installation guide, architecture docs, agents.md, constraint monitor docs
   - **Update root docs**: provider-configuration.md, docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md
   - **Fix GROK_API_KEY references in docs**: provider-configuration.md lines 23/119, constraint detection docs

8. Current Work:
   The assistant was in **Plan Mode Phase 1-2** (exploration and design) for the comprehensive documentation update task. The documentation-style skill was loaded. Two exploration agents completed thorough analysis of all documentation files. Key files were read directly:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` - full 407 lines
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` - full 293 lines  
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` - full 92 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - full 192 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - full 178 lines
   - `mkdocs.yml` - full 117 lines
   
   The plan file at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/plans/cached-growing-goose.md` still contains the OLD implementation plan (for lib/llm/ code). It needs to be overwritten with the new documentation update plan. The assistant had not yet written the new plan or called ExitPlanMode.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Write the documentation update plan to the plan file and call ExitPlanMode. The plan should cover:
   
   1. Create new PlantUML architecture diagrams for lib/llm/ (e.g., `docs/puml/llm-provider-architecture.puml`, `docs/puml/llm-tier-routing.puml`)
   2. Generate PNGs from the PUML files
   3. Update `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` with new architecture, current models, tier-based routing, lib/llm/ reference, GitHub Models provider, updated cost table
   4. Update `docs/provider-configuration.md` - fix GROK_API_KEY, add lib/llm/ reference, update provider chain
   5. Update `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - mention lib/llm/ delegation
   6. Update `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - add semantic validation section
   7. Update SA README.md and sub-docs (installation, architecture, agents) with new provider chain and model names
   8. Update constraint monitor docs (semantic-constraint-detection.md, semantic-detection-design.md) with current models
   9. Potentially update mkdocs.yml nav with new architecture section for LLM layer
   
   User's exact request: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*.

6. **Documentation Style Skill** was invoked, providing PlantUML naming conventions, style includes, stereotypes, arrow macros, and validation workflow.

7. **Exploration Phase**: Two exploration agents were launched in parallel:
   - Agent 1: Read all 10 LLM-related documentation files, found outdated model names, GROK_API_KEY references, inconsistent provider chain descriptions
   - Agent 2: Explored docs-content/, PUML files, PNG files, standard style file

8. **Plan Mode**: The assistant entered plan mode and read key files:
   - docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md (407 lines) - Has outdated models (mixtral, claude-3-5-sonnet, claude-3-haiku, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), wrong cost tables
   - docs/provider-configuration.md (293 lines) - Has GROK_API_KEY on line 23 and 119, outdated references
   - docs/puml/_standard-style.puml (92 lines) - Standard styling for all diagrams
   - docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md (192 lines) - Mentions "3-tier LLM chain"
   - docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md (178 lines) - No semantic validation section
   - mkdocs.yml (117 lines) - Navigation structure, needs new "LLM Architecture" entry potentially

Key files with outdated content identified:
- docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md: Old models (mixtral, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-haiku-20240307, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), old cost table (Anthropic Claude 3.5, OpenAI GPT-4o), no mention of lib/llm/ unified layer, no GitHub Models provider, no tier-based routing
- docs/provider-configuration.md: GROK_API_KEY (lines 23, 119), old 5-provider chain, no lib/llm/ reference, no tier routing
- SA README.md: "6-Tier LLM Provider Chain" is outdated (was Groq→Gemini→Custom→Anthropic→OpenAI→Ollama), should reflect new lib/llm/ architecture
- SA installation docs: Outdated models (gemini-2.0-flash-exp, claude-sonnet-4-20250514, gpt-4)
- SA architecture docs: Old "5-tier provider chain" references
- SA agents.md: Old provider chain references per agent
- Constraint monitor semantic-constraint-detection.md: claude-3-haiku-20240307, GROK_API_KEY
- Constraint monitor semantic-detection-design.md: claude-3-haiku-20240307, gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o-mini

No existing PUML files for LLM architecture were found - only _standard-style.puml exists. New architecture diagrams need to be created.

The user's request was very comprehensive - update ALL docs, create architecture diagrams, update all PUML/PNG, update MkDocs. The assistant was in the middle of plan mode Phase 2 (Design) when this summary was requested.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:

   **Original request (from previous session)**: Implement a detailed plan for a "Unified LLM Support Layer" (`lib/llm/`) consolidating 3 separate LLM abstractions into a shared library with 5 phases and 26 implementation steps.

   **This session's initial work**: Continue Phase 5 (Cleanup & Docker updates) - GROK→GROQ migration, Docker build updates, import path fixes.

   **User feedback on commit**: Before committing, the user asked:
   - "Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config?"
   - "Have all models you listed been the result of a web research to be current?"
   - "Why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase?"
   
   This led to web research and updating ALL model IDs to current (Feb 2026) versions and removing GROK backward compat entirely.

   **Current request (most recent)**: User said: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **Unified LLM Support Layer** (`lib/llm/`): New shared library with 8 providers, tier-based routing, circuit breaker, LRU cache
   - **Tier-based routing**: fast/standard/premium model tiers with provider priority chains
   - **8 Providers**: Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, GitHub Models, DMR, Ollama, Mock
   - **Current model IDs (Feb 2026)**: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-opus-4-6, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1, o4-mini, llama-3.3-70b-versatile, openai/gpt-oss-120b
   - **Dependency Injection**: MockServiceInterface, BudgetTrackerInterface, SensitivityClassifierInterface
   - **Mode routing**: mock/local/public LLM modes via setModeResolver()
   - **PlantUML documentation style**: Must include `_standard-style.puml`, use kebab-case, use stereotypes for coloring
   - **MkDocs**: Site at docs-content/ directory, Material theme, nav structure in mkdocs.yml

3. Files and Code Sections:

   **Files CREATED in lib/llm/ (Phase 1, previous session)**:
   - `lib/llm/package.json` - Package with optional SDK deps
   - `lib/llm/tsconfig.json` - ES2022, ESNext module, strict, outDir: ./dist

   **Files MODIFIED (Phase 2-5)**:
   - `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/src/engines/semantic-validator.js` - Migrated to LLMService (465→247 lines), updated model routing to use claude-haiku-4-5, gemini-2.5-flash
   - `src/inference/UnifiedInferenceEngine.js` - Migrated to LLMService (771→195 lines), updated routing models
   - `integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/semantic-analyzer.ts` - Migrated to LLMService (2024→1103 lines)
   - `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/src/engines/groq-engine.js` - GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY
   - `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/src/utils/config-manager.js` - GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY, 'grok' config key → 'groq', model updated
   - `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/.env.example` - GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY
   - `docker/Dockerfile.coding-services` - Added lib/llm npm install and tsc build steps

   **Documentation files READ (for planning doc updates)**:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` (407 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Contains outdated models (mixtral-8x7b, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-haiku-20240307, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), old cost table, no mention of lib/llm/ or tier routing, no GitHub Models provider
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` (293 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Has GROK_API_KEY on lines 23 and 119, old 5-provider chain, no lib/llm/ reference
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` (192 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Says "3-tier LLM chain", doesn't mention lib/llm/
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` (178 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: No semantic validation section mentioning LLM
   - `mkdocs.yml` (117 lines) - Nav structure, may need new architecture entry for LLM layer
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` (92 lines) - Standard PlantUML styling for all diagrams
   - Various integration README.md and docs files with outdated provider chains and model names

   **Key outdated content found across docs**:
   - Provider chain described as "Groq → Gemini → Custom LLM → Anthropic → OpenAI → Ollama" (old 6-tier)
   - Should now be tier-based: fast tier (Groq), standard tier (Groq→Anthropic→OpenAI), premium tier (Anthropic→OpenAI→Groq)
   - Old model names: claude-3-haiku-20240307, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, qwen-2.5-32b-instruct
   - GROK_API_KEY references in docs/provider-configuration.md and constraint-monitor docs
   - No architecture diagrams exist for LLM layer (no PUML files besides _standard-style.puml)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Bash output suppression**: Throughout session, bash commands frequently returned empty output. Workaround: write to temp files and read with Read tool.
   - **Grep not finding GROK_API_KEY**: Despite files clearly containing it, Grep returned no matches. Likely a .gitignore or submodule issue. Fixed by reading files directly and using Edit tool.
   - **Import path mismatch**: Consumers imported from `lib/llm/index.js` but TypeScript outputs to `lib/llm/dist/`. Fixed by updating all import paths to `lib/llm/dist/index.js`.
   - **Temp file staged**: `lib/llm/tsc-check-result.txt` was accidentally staged. Fixed with `git rm --cached`.
   - **Submodule dirty state**: Submodules showed as dirty after parent commit. User handled git themselves.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully completed all 5 phases of the Unified LLM Support Layer implementation
   - Web-researched current model IDs from Groq, Anthropic, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, OpenAI, GitHub Models documentation
   - Eliminated GROK_API_KEY backward compat entirely from codebase
   - Updated all model IDs to current Feb 2026 versions
   - Identified comprehensive list of documentation files needing updates

6. All user messages:
   - "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. [detailed summary of previous work]"
   - "commit this" + "/login" command + questions: "Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config? Have all models you listed there '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>-providers.yaml' been the result of a web research to be current? Also, why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase? Or is it necessary to make things work, because we used to call it GROK instead of GROQ for some time? If so, can that not be fixed instead?"
   - [User interrupted tool use during submodule git work] "I have done the git stuff myself. Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Documentation update (current work)**: Update ALL documentation files mentioning LLM usage across the entire codebase
   - **Create architecture diagrams**: New PlantUML diagrams for lib/llm/ architecture (providers, tier routing, circuit breaker flow)
   - **Update existing diagrams**: Update any PNG/PUML references to old provider chains
   - **Update MkDocs**: Potentially add new navigation entry for LLM architecture
   - **Update integration docs**: SA README, installation guide, architecture docs, agents.md, constraint monitor docs
   - **Update root docs**: provider-configuration.md, docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md
   - **Fix GROK_API_KEY references in docs**: provider-configuration.md lines 23/119, constraint detection docs

8. Current Work:
   The assistant was in **Plan Mode Phase 1-2** (exploration and design) for the comprehensive documentation update task. The documentation-style skill was loaded. Two exploration agents completed thorough analysis of all documentation files. Key files were read directly:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` - full 407 lines
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` - full 293 lines  
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` - full 92 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - full 192 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - full 178 lines
   - `mkdocs.yml` - full 117 lines
   
   The plan file at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/plans/cached-growing-goose.md` still contains the OLD implementation plan (for lib/llm/ code). It needs to be overwritten with the new documentation update plan. The assistant had not yet written the new plan or called ExitPlanMode.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Write the documentation update plan to the plan file and call ExitPlanMode. The plan should cover:
   
   1. Create new PlantUML architecture diagrams for lib/llm/ (e.g., `docs/puml/llm-provider-architecture.puml`, `docs/puml/llm-tier-routing.puml`)
   2. Generate PNGs from the PUML files
   3. Update `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` with new architecture, current models, tier-based routing, lib/llm/ reference, GitHub Models provider, updated cost table
   4. Update `docs/provider-configuration.md` - fix GROK_API_KEY, add lib/llm/ reference, update provider chain
   5. Update `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - mention lib/llm/ delegation
   6. Update `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - add semantic validation section
   7. Update SA README.md and sub-docs (installation, architecture, agents) with new provider chain and model names
   8. Update constraint monitor docs (semantic-constraint-detection.md, semantic-detection-design.md) with current models
   9. Potentially update mkdocs.yml nav with new architecture section for LLM layer
   
   User's exact request: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

### Task - 2026-02-10 06:58:26 UTC [07:58:26 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the entire conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation is a continuation from a previous session that implemented a "Unified LLM Support Layer" (`lib/llm/`). Phases 1-4 were completed in the previous session. The summary indicates:
   - Phase 1: Built lib/llm/ standalone library (22 files)
   - Phase 2: Migrated SemanticValidator (465 → 247 lines)
   - Phase 3: Migrated UnifiedInferenceEngine (771 → 195 lines)
   - Phase 4: Migrated SemanticAnalyzer (2024 → 1103 lines)
   - Phase 5: Pending (Cleanup & Docker)

2. **Phase 5 Work**: The assistant continued with Phase 5:
   - Updated task statuses
   - Read files needing GROK→GROQ migration: groq-engine.js, config-manager.js, .env.example
   - Fixed GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY in all files
   - Updated config-manager.js to use 'groq' instead of 'grok' config key
   - Fixed import paths from `lib/llm/index.js` to `lib/llm/dist/index.js` (since TypeScript outputs to dist/)
   - Updated Dockerfile with lib/llm install and build steps
   - Built lib/llm locally, verified TypeScript compilation

3. **User Request for Commit**: User said "commit this" and then asked several questions about model currency:
   - Are Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.5 candidates for config?
   - Were models web-researched to be current?
   - Why does groq have apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can GROK backward compat be eliminated?

4. **Model Updates**: Based on web research, the assistant:
   - Updated ALL model IDs across the codebase to current (Feb 2026) versions
   - Removed GROK_API_KEY backward compat entirely from types.ts, groq-provider.ts, config.ts, llm-providers.yaml
   - Updated Anthropic models: claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-opus-4-6
   - Updated Gemini models: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro (gemini-2.0-flash-exp deprecated March 2026)
   - Updated OpenAI models: gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1, o4-mini
   - Updated Groq: added openai/gpt-oss-120b as premium tier
   - Updated GitHub Models to match OpenAI's current models
   - Updated per-operation routing maps in SemanticValidator and UnifiedInferenceEngine
   - Rebuilt lib/llm, verified TypeScript compilation
   - Created commit: `712c8abe feat: add unified LLM support layer (lib/llm/) and migrate consumers`

5. **User did git work themselves** and then asked for comprehensive documentation updates:
   - "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer"
   - "Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect"
   - "ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs"
   - "Update all related puml/png's"
   - "Also update the MkDocs"

6. **Documentation Style Skill** was invoked, providing PlantUML naming conventions, style includes, stereotypes, arrow macros, and validation workflow.

7. **Exploration Phase**: Two exploration agents were launched in parallel:
   - Agent 1: Read all 10 LLM-related documentation files, found outdated model names, GROK_API_KEY references, inconsistent provider chain descriptions
   - Agent 2: Explored docs-content/, PUML files, PNG files, standard style file

   - `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/src/engines/semantic-validator.js` - Migrated to LLMService (465→247 lines), updated model routing to use claude-haiku-4-5, gemini-2.5-flash
   - `src/inference/UnifiedInferenceEngine.js` - Migrated to LLMService (771→195 lines), updated routing models
   - `integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/semantic-analyzer.ts` - Migrated to LLMService (2024→1103 lines)
   - `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/src/engines/groq-engine.js` - GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY
   - `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/src/utils/config-manager.js` - GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY, 'grok' config key → 'groq', model updated
   - `integrations/mcp-constraint-monitor/.env.example` - GROK_API_KEY → GROQ_API_KEY
   - `docker/Dockerfile.coding-services` - Added lib/llm npm install and tsc build steps

   **Documentation files READ (for planning doc updates)**:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` (407 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Contains outdated models (mixtral-8x7b, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-haiku-20240307, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini), old cost table, no mention of lib/llm/ or tier routing, no GitHub Models provider
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` (293 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Has GROK_API_KEY on lines 23 and 119, old 5-provider chain, no lib/llm/ reference
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` (192 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: Says "3-tier LLM chain", doesn't mention lib/llm/
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` (178 lines) - **NEEDS UPDATE**: No semantic validation section mentioning LLM
   - `mkdocs.yml` (117 lines) - Nav structure, may need new architecture entry for LLM layer
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` (92 lines) - Standard PlantUML styling for all diagrams
   - Various integration README.md and docs files with outdated provider chains and model names

   **Key outdated content found across docs**:
   - Provider chain described as "Groq → Gemini → Custom LLM → Anthropic → OpenAI → Ollama" (old 6-tier)
   - Should now be tier-based: fast tier (Groq), standard tier (Groq→Anthropic→OpenAI), premium tier (Anthropic→OpenAI→Groq)
   - Old model names: claude-3-haiku-20240307, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, qwen-2.5-32b-instruct
   - GROK_API_KEY references in docs/provider-configuration.md and constraint-monitor docs
   - No architecture diagrams exist for LLM layer (no PUML files besides _standard-style.puml)

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Bash output suppression**: Throughout session, bash commands frequently returned empty output. Workaround: write to temp files and read with Read tool.
   - **Grep not finding GROK_API_KEY**: Despite files clearly containing it, Grep returned no matches. Likely a .gitignore or submodule issue. Fixed by reading files directly and using Edit tool.
   - **Import path mismatch**: Consumers imported from `lib/llm/index.js` but TypeScript outputs to `lib/llm/dist/`. Fixed by updating all import paths to `lib/llm/dist/index.js`.
   - **Temp file staged**: `lib/llm/tsc-check-result.txt` was accidentally staged. Fixed with `git rm --cached`.
   - **Submodule dirty state**: Submodules showed as dirty after parent commit. User handled git themselves.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully completed all 5 phases of the Unified LLM Support Layer implementation
   - Web-researched current model IDs from Groq, Anthropic, <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>, OpenAI, GitHub Models documentation
   - Eliminated GROK_API_KEY backward compat entirely from codebase
   - Updated all model IDs to current Feb 2026 versions
   - Identified comprehensive list of documentation files needing updates

6. All user messages:
   - "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. [detailed summary of previous work]"
   - "commit this" + "/login" command + questions: "Anthropic has opus 4.6 and sonnet 4.5 - are they not candidates for the config? Have all models you listed there '<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>-providers.yaml' been the result of a web research to be current? Also, why does groq have an apiKeyEnvVarAlt? Can this be eliminated from the codebase? Or is it necessary to make things work, because we used to call it GROK instead of GROQ for some time? If so, can that not be fixed instead?"
   - [User interrupted tool use during submodule git work] "I have done the git stuff myself. Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Documentation update (current work)**: Update ALL documentation files mentioning LLM usage across the entire codebase
   - **Create architecture diagrams**: New PlantUML diagrams for lib/llm/ architecture (providers, tier routing, circuit breaker flow)
   - **Update existing diagrams**: Update any PNG/PUML references to old provider chains
   - **Update MkDocs**: Potentially add new navigation entry for LLM architecture
   - **Update integration docs**: SA README, installation guide, architecture docs, agents.md, constraint monitor docs
   - **Update root docs**: provider-configuration.md, docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md
   - **Fix GROK_API_KEY references in docs**: provider-configuration.md lines 23/119, constraint detection docs

8. Current Work:
   The assistant was in **Plan Mode Phase 1-2** (exploration and design) for the comprehensive documentation update task. The documentation-style skill was loaded. Two exploration agents completed thorough analysis of all documentation files. Key files were read directly:
   - `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` - full 407 lines
   - `docs/provider-configuration.md` - full 293 lines  
   - `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml` - full 92 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - full 192 lines
   - `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - full 178 lines
   - `mkdocs.yml` - full 117 lines
   
   The plan file at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/plans/cached-growing-goose.md` still contains the OLD implementation plan (for lib/llm/ code). It needs to be overwritten with the new documentation update plan. The assistant had not yet written the new plan or called ExitPlanMode.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Write the documentation update plan to the plan file and call ExitPlanMode. The plan should cover:
   
   1. Create new PlantUML architecture diagrams for lib/llm/ (e.g., `docs/puml/llm-provider-architecture.puml`, `docs/puml/llm-tier-routing.puml`)
   2. Generate PNGs from the PUML files
   3. Update `docs-content/guides/llm-providers.md` with new architecture, current models, tier-based routing, lib/llm/ reference, GitHub Models provider, updated cost table
   4. Update `docs/provider-configuration.md` - fix GROK_API_KEY, add lib/llm/ reference, update provider chain
   5. Update `docs-content/integrations/semantic-analysis.md` - mention lib/llm/ delegation
   6. Update `docs-content/integrations/constraint-monitor.md` - add semantic validation section
   7. Update SA README.md and sub-docs (installation, architecture, agents) with new provider chain and model names
   8. Update constraint monitor docs (semantic-constraint-detection.md, semantic-detection-design.md) with current models
   9. Potentially update mkdocs.yml nav with new architecture section for LLM layer
   
   User's exact request: "Now update the docs after this significant rework of the LLM layer. Ensure that you provide architecture diagrams of this important aspect and that ALL mentions of LLM usage are updated across the ENTIRE docs (in docs as well as in integrations/*. Update all related puml/png's. Also update the MkDocs"
