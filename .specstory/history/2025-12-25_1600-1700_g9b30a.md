### Text Exchange - 2025-12-25 15:41:35 UTC [16:41:35 CEST]

**Assistant Response:** Done. The fix is applied and all health monitors have been stopped. 

**Summary of what was happening:**
1. Multiple `statusline-health-monitor` processes were running with `--auto-heal` 
2. When VKB was detected as unhealthy, auto-healing called `vkb start` without `--no-browser`
3. This opened a new browser window every time auto-healing triggered
4. Multiple monitors running multiplied the problem

**Fixes applied:**
1. Added `--no-browser` to the auto-heal VKB restart command (line 1613)
2. ...

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
