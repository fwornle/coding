Perfect! I've successfully restored all the September LSL files. Here's what happened:

**The Issue:**
- Those LSL files from September 26-28 were **committed to git** in commit b35c131 (5 commits ago)
- But they were **deleted from the filesystem** at some point without that deletion being committed
- So git kept showing them as "deleted" in the working directory

**The Fix:**
I restored all deleted LSL history files from HEAD using:
```bash
git restore --source=HEAD {file}
```

**Current Git Status:**
Now your changeset is clean and only shows:
1. **Modified files** from today's work:
   - `.spec-workflow/session.json`
   - `docs/presentation/images/lsl-architecture.png` (updated with landscape layout)
   - `docs/presentation/puml/lsl-architecture.puml` (updated with larger fonts)
2. **Deleted files**: `docs/presentation/images/adaptive-lsl-system.png` and its `.puml` source
3. **Untracked files**: Today's new LSL session logs (2025-10-28)

All those September LSL files are back on disk and no longer showing as deleted!
