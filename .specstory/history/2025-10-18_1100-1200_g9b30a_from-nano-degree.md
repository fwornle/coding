# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities


### Assistant

I'll read the recent session logs to provide continuity. Let me start by determining the current project and finding the relevant session logs.

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",
  "description": "Get current working directory to determine project"
}
```

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t .specstory/history/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1",
  "description": "Find newest local session log"
}
```

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md 2>/dev/null | head -1",
  "description": "Find newest redirected session log from coding"
}
```

Now let me read both session logs:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-10-18_1100-1200_g9b30a.md"
}
```

### Assistant

**Tool:** Read

Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.
