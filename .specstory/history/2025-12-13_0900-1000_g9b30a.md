[Image #1] - why is the vibe step not using LLMs? That's wrong. Same for many other nodes. And you always claim to use anthropic - also not accurate, I believe. And what models are you using? Improve and correct the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> information given in each node

### Text Exchange - 2025-12-13 08:33:35 UTC [09:33:35 CEST]

**User Message:** does the memgraph MCP server not use LLMs? And, you often say LLM: auto and then list a bunch of LLMs underneath. Is this because you don't know which one we actually used? Can you not just say LLM: and then state the one that's been used (and 'none' if none has been used and '----' if you don't know)? Or is it sometimes a variety of models and it is chosen "automatically" depending on ... what? by whom?

### Text Exchange - 2025-12-13 08:41:38 UTC [09:41:38 CEST]

**User Message:** this is confusing: you say LLM: --- and then tech stack.... +LLM. Make sure you have accurate information. I expect the vibe step, the git step, ... to use LLMs and it should be clear from the code which one is used, no? ultrathink, use serena to understand all 13 agents and then list clear and unabiguous information.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation continues from a previous session about the UKB Workflow Monitor in the System Health Dashboard. Previous work involved moving workflow state management to Redux.

2. **Wiggle Animation Fix**: 
   - User requested wiggling on hover should stop after 4 wiggles and only resume...
