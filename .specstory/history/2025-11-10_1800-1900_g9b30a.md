Perfect, there's a `main` branch. Let me checkout main and merge the feature branch:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "git checkout main && git merge feat/online-learning --no-edit",
  "description": "Checkout main and merge feat/online-learning"

**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "git status --porcelain",
  "description": "Check detailed git status"

These are LSL files that have been modified or created during the current session (the batch processors and live monitors are updating them). I need to commit these first:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "git add .specstory/history/*.md && git commit -m \"chore: update LSL files from current session\n\nSession work includes:\n- Fixed enhanced-transcript-monitor.js duplicate instance issue\n- Regenerated all LSL files for coding, nano-degree, and curriculum-alignment\n- Fixed bin/coding symlink resolution issue\n- Ongoing batch processing updates to LSL files\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>

### Assistant

Good! Now let me checkout main and merge:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json

}
```

### User

Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
Switched to branch 'main'

I see that checking out main reverted the symlink fix I made to `bin/coding`. Now let me merge the feature branch:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "git merge feat/online-learning --no-edit",
  "description": "Merge feat/online-learning into main"

### Assistant

Perfect! The merge was successful with a fast-forward merge. Let me verify the merge and check if we're on main:

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "git status && git log --oneline -5",
  "description": "Verify merge and check recent commits"
}
```

### User

**Result:** ✅ Success

On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 21 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
832a638 chore: update LSL files from current session
59df61d fix: ukb cli
eb3736d fix: broken symlink (to SCRIPT_DIR) fixed
9c9a7c1 docs: document Detailed Session Breakdown feature in classification status files
699d739 feat: override mechanism to break constraint loops (eg. when working on constraints themselves)

### Assistant

Excellent! The merge is complete. The branch `feat/online-learning` has been successfully merged into `main`. 

## Summary:

✅ **Branch Merge Complete**
- Successfully merged `feat/online-learning` → `main`
- Fast-forward merge with 21 commits ahead of origin/main
- Working tree is clean

**Key commits in the merge:**
1. `832a638` - Update LSL files from current session
2. `eb3736d` - **Fix broken symlink resolution in bin/coding** (the symlink fix I just made)
3. `9c9a7c1` - Document Detailed Session Breakdown feature
4. `699d739` - Override mechanism for constraint loops

The `bin/coding` symlink fix is now part of main, so you should be able to launch new coding sessions without the "Cannot find module" error.
