### Bash - 2026-02-08 14:10:05 UTC [15:10:05 CEST]

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -lt /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ | head -10",
  "description": "List recent LSL files sorted by modification time"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

### Bash - 2026-02-08 14:10:05 UTC [15:10:05 CEST]

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "git -C /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding diff --stat HEAD~5..HEAD",
  "description": "Show files changed in recent commits"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "grep -n \"combined-status-line\\|statusline\\|health\\|session\\|I9\\|iso-9001\\|copilot\\|copi\\|generali\" /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2026-02-08_1300-1400_c197ef.md | head -20",
  "description": "Find key topics in 1300 session"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
5:**Focus:** Live session logging
12:This session captures real-time tool interactions and exchanges.
27:**Assistant Response:** Confirmed: old project-local health files don't exist, only centralized ones do. Now let me check the `^[[I` escape character issue in the launcher.

**Assistant Response:** 


The `^[[O` is a terminal "focus out" escape sequence. I see the fix attempt on line 277 of `launch-claude.sh`, but it's too late - it only fires right before `exec`. The focus event arrives during the service startup phase. Let me move the disable earlier.

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -lt /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ | head -10",
  "description": "List recent LSL files sorted by modification time"

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range

   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files

**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "git -C /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding log --oneline -15",

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Bash - 2026-02-08 14:10:05 UTC [15:10:05 CEST]

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -lt /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ | head -10",
  "description": "List recent LSL files sorted by modification time"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>unch-claude.sh"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

This is where tmux wrapping should happen.\n\n2. **`scripts/claude-mcp-launcher.sh`** - The final launcher that runs `NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 claude --mcp-config \"$MCP_CONFIG\" \"$@\"` (line 147). Has cleanup traps for post-session logging.\n\n3. **`bin/coding`** - Top-level dispatcher. Already disables terminal focus reporting at line 10 (`printf '\\e[?1004l'`).\n\n4. **`.claude/settings.local.json`** - Currently has native statusLine config that would become redundant.\n\n5. **`scripts/combined-status-line.js`** - The status line script (2050+ lines) that outputs tmux formatting codes.\n\n6. **`scripts/combined-status-line-wrapper.js`** - Thin wrapper that sets CODING_REPO and calls combined-status-line.js.\n\n7. **`~/.tmux.conf`** - Already has copi status line config.\n\n## Design Constraints\n\n1. Claude Code is an interactive <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> - must work correctly inside a tmux pane\n2. The tmux session name should be distinguishable (e.g., `coding-claude-...`)\n3. Session cleanup traps in `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` must still work\n4. The `.claude/settings.local.json` statusLine should be removed/disabled since tmux handles it now\n5. Must handle the case where tmux is not installed (graceful fallback)\n6. Must handle the case where a tmux session with the same name already exists (reattach or create new)\n7. The approach should be agent-agnostic where possible - both Claude and CoPilot benefit from the same tmux status bar\n8. Environment variables (CODING_REPO, CODING_AGENT, etc.) must be available inside the tmux session\n\n## Questions to address in the plan:\n1. Should we wrap at the `launch-claude.sh` level (creating tmux there) or at the `bin/coding` level?\n2. Session naming convention for tmux sessions\n3. How to pass all the exported environment variables into the tmux session\n4. What happens to `.claude/settings.local.json` statusLine config - remove it or keep as fallback?\n5. How to handle the post-session cleanup traps\n6. Should `ensure_statusline_config()` in agent-common-setup.sh still inject native statusLine into project settings?"

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

Update to mention tmux wrapping:

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### TaskCreate - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

## Verification

1. **Run `coding --claude --dry-run`** -- should show tmux in output message
2. **Run `coding --claude`** -- should launch inside tmux with status bar at bottom
3. **Verify status bar renders** -- `#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]` should render as underlined "C", not literal text
4. **Verify Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> works** -- interactive input, scrolling, mouse all functional inside tmux

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

| `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` | MODIFY (`ensure_statusline_config`, ~line 448) |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | MODIFY (remove lines 187-190) |

## Verification

1. **Run `coding --claude --dry-run`** -- should show tmux in output message
2. **Run `coding --claude`** -- should launch inside tmux with status bar at bottom
3. **Verify status bar renders** -- `#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]` should render as underlined "C", not literal text
4. **Verify Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> works** -- interactive input, scrolling, mouse all functional inside tmux
5. **Test nested tmux** -- start a tmux session first, then run `coding --claude` inside it -- should configure existing session, not nest
6. **Test fallback** -- temporarily rename tmux binary, run `coding --claude` -- should launch directly without crash

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)

### TaskUpdate - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:

tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)

    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

## Verification

1. **Run `coding --claude --dry-run`** -- should show tmux in output message

3. **Verify status bar renders** -- `#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]` should render as underlined "C", not literal text
4. **Verify Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> works** -- interactive input, scrolling, mouse all functional inside tmux
5. **Test nested tmux** -- start a tmux session first, then run `coding --claude` inside it -- should configure existing session, not nest
6. **Test fallback** -- temporarily rename tmux binary, run `coding --claude` -- should launch directly without crash


If you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-coding/f3875007-8506-4051-a722-30504835e3f8.jsonl

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash

  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

### Bash - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

## Verification

1. **Run `coding --claude --dry-run`** -- should show tmux in output message
2. **Run `coding --claude`** -- should launch inside tmux with status bar at bottom
3. **Verify status bar renders** -- `#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]` should render as underlined "C", not literal text
4. **Verify Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> works** -- interactive input, scrolling, mouse all functional inside tmux
5. **Test nested tmux** -- start a tmux session first, then run `coding --claude` inside it -- should configure existing session, not nest
6. **Test fallback** -- temporarily rename tmux binary, run `coding --claude` -- should launch directly without crash

- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

### TaskUpdate - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps

tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### TaskCreate - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

### TaskUpdate - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

### TaskUpdate - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly

- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

### TaskUpdate - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

### Edit - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

### Bash - 2026-02-08 14:34:12 UTC [15:34:12 CEST]

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)
}
```

### 2. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` (line 276-279)

Replace the final `exec` with the tmux wrapper:

```bash
# Before:
exec "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"

# After:
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/tmux-session-wrapper.sh"
tmux_session_wrapper "$CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp" "$@"
```

### 3. MODIFY: `scripts/agent-common-setup.sh` -- `ensure_statusline_config()` (line 448)

Add early-return guard when tmux is active:

```bash
ensure_statusline_config() {
  # Skip native statusLine when tmux handles the status bar
  if [ -n "$TMUX" ] || [ "$CODING_TMUX_MODE" = "true" ]; then
    return 0
  fi
  # ... existing logic unchanged (fallback for non-tmux scenarios) ...
}
```

### 4. MODIFY: `.claude/settings.local.json` (lines 187-190)

Remove the `statusLine` block -- tmux renders it now. The file keeps permissions and hooks intact.

```diff
-  "statusLine": {
-    "type": "command",
-    "command": "CODING_REPO=/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding node <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>mbined-status-line.js"
-  }
```

### 5. MODIFY: `scripts/launch-claude.sh` dry-run message (line 80)

Update to mention tmux wrapping:
```bash
log "DRY-RUN: Would launch in tmux: $CODING_REPO/bin/claude-mcp"
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Wrap at `launch-claude.sh` level** (not `bin/coding`) -- keeps dispatcher agent-agnostic, matches where copilot wraps
- **Shared wrapper script** -- ready for copilot to use later (replacing Node.js copi tmux logic)
- **Tmux nesting guard** -- if already in tmux, configure current session's status bar and exec directly
- **Graceful fallback** -- if tmux not installed, exec directly (degraded: no status bar)
- **Per-session config** -- uses `tmux set-option -t <session>`, not `-g`, to avoid polluting other tmux sessions
- **Cleanup traps preserved** -- `claude-mcp-launcher.sh` traps fire inside the tmux pane; `launch-claude.sh` traps fire after tmux attach returns

**User Request:** Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Wrap Claude in tmux for Proper Status Line Rendering

## Context

The `combined-status-line.js` outputs tmux-specific formatting codes (`#[underscore]`, `#[nounderscore]` at line 1670) that render correctly in CoPilot's tmux session but appear as **literal text** in Claude Code's native statusLine:

```
[#[underscore]C#[nounderscore]🟢I9🌲]
```

Rather than maintaining two rendering modes, we unify all agents under tmux -- the same pattern CoPilot already uses successfully.

## Changes

### 1. NEW: `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh` -- Shared tmux wrapper function

Agent-agnostic bash function that wraps any agent command in a tmux session with the coding status bar.

```bash
tmux_session_wrapper() {
  # 1. If tmux not installed → fallback: exec directly (graceful degradation)
  # 2. If already inside tmux ($TMUX set) → configure current session's status-right, then exec directly
  # 3. Otherwise → create detached session, configure status bar, attach

  Session name: "coding-${CODING_AGENT:-agent}-$$"

  Status bar config (per-session, not global):
    - status-interval 5
    - status-right-length 200
    - status-style bg=default,fg=default  (neutral, avoids overriding terminal theme)
    - status-right: "#(CODING_REPO=... node .../combined-status-line.js 2>/dev/null || echo '[Status Offline]') %H:%M"
    - mouse on  (forward mouse events to Claude <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>)

I see you've opened the settings file. The `statusLine` block has been removed as planned — the file now ends with just the `hooks` section. Is everything looking correct, or do you have any concerns?

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ | head -5",
  "description": "List most recent LSL files"

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ | head -5",
  "description": "List most recent LSL files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides ``:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

### Task - 2026-02-08 14:57:39 UTC [15:57:39 CEST]

**User Request:** # Documentation Style Guide

Enforce consistent styling for documentation artifacts (PlantUML, Mermaid, markdown, PNG diagrams).

## Instructions

When creating or modifying documentation artifacts, follow these guidelines strictly.

---

## PlantUML Diagrams (.puml)

### File Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: Use kebab-case, descriptive names. NEVER use incremental suffixes.

**Correct**:
- `health-verification-flow.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components.puml`

**WRONG** (constraint violation):
- `health-verification-flow-2.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture-v2.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components-new.puml`

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

---

## PNG Generation

### Generating PNGs from PlantUML

Use the PlantUML JAR or online service:

```bash
# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```
```

### Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive node labels
2. Keep diagrams focused - split large diagrams into multiple
3. Use subgraphs for logical grouping
4. Prefer `graph TD` (top-down) over `graph LR` (left-right) for readability

---

## Markdown Documentation

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `api-quota-checker.md`
- Use `README.md` for directory index files
- Never use spaces or special characters

### Structure

1. Start with H1 title matching the topic
2. Include brief overview paragraph
3. Use H2 for major sections
4. Use H3 for subsections
5. Include code examples where applicable

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal links: `[Status Line](./status-line.md)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links
- Verify links work before committing

---

## Validation Workflow

Before committing documentation changes:

1. **PlantUML**: Verify syntax by generating PNG
2. **Mermaid**: Preview in VS Code or GitHub
3. **Markdown**: Check rendering in preview
4. **Links**: Verify all internal links work
5. **Images**: Ensure referenced images exist

---

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Incremental naming** (`-2`, `-v2`, `-new` suffixes)
2. **Missing style include** in PlantUML
3. **Horizontal-heavy layouts** causing scroll
4. **Orphaned images** (PNG without source PUML)
5. **Broken internal links**
6. **Inconsistent component colors** (not using stereotypes)

---

## Quick Reference

| Artifact | Location | Naming | Style |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| PlantUML | `docs/puml/` | kebab-case.puml | Include `_standard-style.puml` |
| PNG | `docs/images/` | match-source.png | Generated from PUML |
| Markdown | `docs/*/` | kebab-case.md | H1 title, H2 sections |
| Mermaid | Inline | N/A | graph TD preferred |

## PlantUML Diagrams (.puml)

### File Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: Use kebab-case, descriptive names. NEVER use incremental suffixes.

**Correct**:
- `health-verification-flow.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components.puml`

**WRONG** (constraint violation):
- `health-verification-flow-2.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture-v2.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components-new.puml`

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

---

## PNG Generation

### Generating PNGs from PlantUML

Use the PlantUML JAR or online service:

```bash
# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```
```

### Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive node labels
2. Keep diagrams focused - split large diagrams into multiple
3. Use subgraphs for logical grouping
4. Prefer `graph TD` (top-down) over `graph LR` (left-right) for readability

---

## Markdown Documentation

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `api-quota-checker.md`
- Use `README.md` for directory index files
- Never use spaces or special characters

### Structure

1. Start with H1 title matching the topic
2. Include brief overview paragraph
3. Use H2 for major sections
4. Use H3 for subsections
5. Include code examples where applicable

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal links: `[Status Line](./status-line.md)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links
- Verify links work before committing

---

## Validation Workflow

Before committing documentation changes:

1. **PlantUML**: Verify syntax by generating PNG
2. **Mermaid**: Preview in VS Code or GitHub
3. **Markdown**: Check rendering in preview
4. **Links**: Verify all internal links work
5. **Images**: Ensure referenced images exist

---

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Incremental naming** (`-2`, `-v2`, `-new` suffixes)
2. **Missing style include** in PlantUML
3. **Horizontal-heavy layouts** causing scroll
4. **Orphaned images** (PNG without source PUML)
5. **Broken internal links**
6. **Inconsistent component colors** (not using stereotypes)

---

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

---

## PNG Generation

### Generating PNGs from PlantUML

Use the PlantUML JAR or online service:

```bash
# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```
```

### Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive node labels
2. Keep diagrams focused - split large diagrams into multiple
3. Use subgraphs for logical grouping
4. Prefer `graph TD` (top-down) over `graph LR` (left-right) for readability

---

## Markdown Documentation

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `api-quota-checker.md`
- Use `README.md` for directory index files
- Never use spaces or special characters

### Structure

1. Start with H1 title matching the topic
2. Include brief overview paragraph
3. Use H2 for major sections
4. Use H3 for subsections
5. Include code examples where applicable

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal links: `[Status Line](./status-line.md)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links
- Verify links work before committing

---

## Validation Workflow

Before committing documentation changes:

1. **PlantUML**: Verify syntax by generating PNG
2. **Mermaid**: Preview in VS Code or GitHub
3. **Markdown**: Check rendering in preview
4. **Links**: Verify all internal links work
5. **Images**: Ensure referenced images exist

---

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Incremental naming** (`-2`, `-v2`, `-new` suffixes)
2. **Missing style include** in PlantUML
3. **Horizontal-heavy layouts** causing scroll
4. **Orphaned images** (PNG without source PUML)
5. **Broken internal links**
6. **Inconsistent component colors** (not using stereotypes)

---

**User Request:** # Documentation Style Guide

Enforce consistent styling for documentation artifacts (PlantUML, Mermaid, markdown, PNG diagrams).

## Instructions

When creating or modifying documentation artifacts, follow these guidelines strictly.

---

## PlantUML Diagrams (.puml)

### File Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: Use kebab-case, descriptive names. NEVER use incremental suffixes.

**Correct**:
- `health-verification-flow.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components.puml`

**WRONG** (constraint violation):
- `health-verification-flow-2.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture-v2.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components-new.puml`

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

---

## PNG Generation

### Generating PNGs from PlantUML

Use the PlantUML JAR or online service:

```bash
# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```
```

### Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive node labels
2. Keep diagrams focused - split large diagrams into multiple
3. Use subgraphs for logical grouping
4. Prefer `graph TD` (top-down) over `graph LR` (left-right) for readability

---

## Markdown Documentation

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `api-quota-checker.md`
- Use `README.md` for directory index files
- Never use spaces or special characters

### Structure

1. Start with H1 title matching the topic
2. Include brief overview paragraph
3. Use H2 for major sections
4. Use H3 for subsections
5. Include code examples where applicable

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal links: `[Status Line](./status-line.md)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links
- Verify links work before committing

---

## Validation Workflow

Before committing documentation changes:

1. **PlantUML**: Verify syntax by generating PNG
2. **Mermaid**: Preview in VS Code or GitHub
3. **Markdown**: Check rendering in preview
4. **Links**: Verify all internal links work
5. **Images**: Ensure referenced images exist

---

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Incremental naming** (`-2`, `-v2`, `-new` suffixes)
2. **Missing style include** in PlantUML
3. **Horizontal-heavy layouts** causing scroll
4. **Orphaned images** (PNG without source PUML)
5. **Broken internal links**
6. **Inconsistent component colors** (not using stereotypes)

---

## PlantUML Diagrams (.puml)

### File Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: Use kebab-case, descriptive names. NEVER use incremental suffixes.

**Correct**:
- `health-verification-flow.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components.puml`

**WRONG** (constraint violation):
- `health-verification-flow-2.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture-v2.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components-new.puml`

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```
```

### Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive node labels
2. Keep diagrams focused - split large diagrams into multiple
3. Use subgraphs for logical grouping
4. Prefer `graph TD` (top-down) over `graph LR` (left-right) for readability

---

## Markdown Documentation

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `api-quota-checker.md`
- Use `README.md` for directory index files
- Never use spaces or special characters

### Structure

1. Start with H1 title matching the topic
2. Include brief overview paragraph
3. Use H2 for major sections
4. Use H3 for subsections
5. Include code examples where applicable

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal links: `[Status Line](./status-line.md)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links
- Verify links work before committing

---

## Validation Workflow

Before committing documentation changes:

1. **PlantUML**: Verify syntax by generating PNG
2. **Mermaid**: Preview in VS Code or GitHub
3. **Markdown**: Check rendering in preview
4. **Links**: Verify all internal links work
5. **Images**: Ensure referenced images exist

---

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Incremental naming** (`-2`, `-v2`, `-new` suffixes)
2. **Missing style include** in PlantUML
3. **Horizontal-heavy layouts** causing scroll
4. **Orphaned images** (PNG without source PUML)
5. **Broken internal links**
6. **Inconsistent component colors** (not using stereotypes)

---

## Quick Reference

| Artifact | Location | Naming | Style |

**User Request:** # Documentation Style Guide

Enforce consistent styling for documentation artifacts (PlantUML, Mermaid, markdown, PNG diagrams).

## Instructions

When creating or modifying documentation artifacts, follow these guidelines strictly.

---

## PlantUML Diagrams (.puml)

### File Naming Convention

**CRITICAL**: Use kebab-case, descriptive names. NEVER use incremental suffixes.

**Correct**:
- `health-verification-flow.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components.puml`

**WRONG** (constraint violation):
- `health-verification-flow-2.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture-v2.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components-new.puml`

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

---

## PNG Generation

### Generating PNGs from PlantUML

Use the PlantUML JAR or online service:

```bash
# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid

- `health-verification-flow-2.puml`
- `knowledge-architecture-v2.puml`
- `constraint-monitor-components-new.puml`

If updating an existing diagram, **modify the existing file** rather than creating a new version.

### Standard Style Include

All PlantUML files MUST include the standard style at the top:

```plantuml
@startuml diagram-name
!include _standard-style.puml

' ... diagram content ...

@enduml
```

The style file is located at:
- `docs/puml/_standard-style.puml`
- `docs/presentation/puml/_standard-style.puml`

### Layout Guidelines

1. **Prefer vertical layouts** - Avoid excessive width that requires horizontal scrolling
2. **Use `top to bottom direction`** for most diagrams
3. **Use `left to right direction`** only for sequence diagrams or when horizontal flow is semantically meaningful
4. **Group related components** using packages or rectangles

### Component Stereotypes

Use these stereotypes for consistent coloring:

| Stereotype | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `<<api>>` | Light Blue | API endpoints, REST interfaces |
| `<<core>>` | Light Green | Core business logic |
| `<<storage>>` | Light Yellow | Databases, file storage |
| `<<cli>>` | Light Pink | Command-line interfaces |
| `<<util>>` | Light Gray | Utility/helper components |
| `<<agent>>` | Soft Blue | AI agents, autonomous components |
| `<<infra>>` | Light <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> | Infrastructure components |
| `<<external>>` | Neutral Gray | External systems |

### Arrow Macros

Use defined macros for consistent arrow styling:

```plantuml
SYNC_LINE     ' Red solid line - synchronous calls
ASYNC_LINE    ' Green dashed - async/event-based
DATA_LINE     ' <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> solid - data flow
CONTROL_LINE  ' Purple solid - control flow
OPTIONAL_LINE ' Gray dotted - optional paths
```

---

## PNG Generation

### Generating PNGs from PlantUML

Use the PlantUML JAR or online service:

```bash
# Local generation (preferred)
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng docs/puml/diagram-name.puml

# Or use the docs script if available
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

### PNG Naming

PNG files should match their source PUML file:
- `health-verification-flow.puml` → `health-verification-flow.png`

### Output Location

PNGs should be generated to:
- `docs/images/` - For markdown documentation references
- `docs/presentation/png/` - For presentation diagrams

---

## Mermaid Diagrams

### Inline in Markdown

Use fenced code blocks with `mermaid` language:

```markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[End]
```
```

### Style Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive node labels
2. Keep diagrams focused - split large diagrams into multiple
3. Use subgraphs for logical grouping
4. Prefer `graph TD` (top-down) over `graph LR` (left-right) for readability

---

## Markdown Documentation

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `api-quota-checker.md`
- Use `README.md` for directory index files
- Never use spaces or special characters

### Structure

1. Start with H1 title matching the topic
2. Include brief overview paragraph
3. Use H2 for major sections
4. Use H3 for subsections
5. Include code examples where applicable

### Links

- Use relative paths for internal links: `[Status Line](./status-line.md)`
- Use absolute URLs for external links
- Verify links work before committing

---

## Validation Workflow

Before committing documentation changes:

1. **PlantUML**: Verify syntax by generating PNG
2. **Mermaid**: Preview in VS Code or GitHub
3. **Markdown**: Check rendering in preview
4. **Links**: Verify all internal links work
5. **Images**: Ensure referenced images exist

---

## Common Violations to Avoid

1. **Incremental naming** (`-2`, `-v2`, `-new` suffixes)
2. **Missing style include** in PlantUML
3. **Horizontal-heavy layouts** causing scroll
4. **Orphaned images** (PNG without source PUML)
5. **Broken internal links**
6. **Inconsistent component colors** (not using stereotypes)

---
