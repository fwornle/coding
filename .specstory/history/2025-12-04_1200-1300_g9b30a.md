**User Message:** the JSON export MUST NEVER be out of sync - verify the persistence functionality and check, why we still get these discrepancies, despite having designed a system which ALWAYS manipulates the graphology in-memory DB first, then automatically syncs this to LevelDB and automatically exports the LevelDB contents to the serialized JSON files... or (the other way round - incoming JSON changes ... after a git fetch/pull get synced to LevelDB and graphology). Read the associated documentation and check...

NEVER edit shared-memory.json directly - ALWAYS use vkb command or MCP tools
vkb server for visualization, MCP semantic-analysis tools for programmatic access
