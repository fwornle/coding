**User Message:** we already know this. you are expected to run ukb when I tell you to update the knowledge-base in claude. the question is are you now properly triggering the actual workflow (i.e. no mocked stuff)? And... you just detected that the last run of ukb was 3h ago. This is not the way to look at this. It should be the last SUCCESSFUL run which ran all through to updating the KB with insights. You just look at when ukb got run... but the last successful run which produced proper results was weeks ago, ...

**User Message:** How?! We just fixed this...\
Yes, that's the VKB server holding the LevelDB lock. From the earlier lock-free architecture discussions, the proper solution is
  that the MCP workflow should use VKB's HTTP API instead of direct LevelDB access. However, for now, let me temporarily stop VKB
  to run the analysis:
