### Text Exchange - 2026-01-25 09:59:30 UTC [10:59:30 CEST]

**Assistant Response:** The health-verifier daemon is now running (PID 7455) and has updated the verification status to `09:59:26` (current time). The statusline should now show [🏥✓] instead of [🏥⏰].

The issue was that the health-verifier daemon had stopped running at some point (last heartbeat was from 07:04). The daemon runs periodic health checks (default 60 seconds) and updates `.health/verification-status.json`. The combined-status-line marks the status as "stale" if the file is more than 2 minutes old.


**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
