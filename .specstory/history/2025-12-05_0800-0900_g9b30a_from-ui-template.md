**User Request:** The documentation is getting convoluted. Make it super consise, while not loosing any essential content... but we don't want double information. There should be a very lean top-level structure of the document tree (flat, lean) so that it becomes obvious where to look for information

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json

  "command": "git push origin-public develop",
