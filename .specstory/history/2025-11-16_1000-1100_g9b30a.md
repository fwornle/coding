## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t

**User Message:** read back the LSLs - we embarked on this side quest (fixing the constraint system) when you tried to document the cleaned-up ukb system (I believe). Complete this task. use serena to check the docs vs. codebase to ensure the documentation fully (and only) describes the current implementation correctly. ultrathink
