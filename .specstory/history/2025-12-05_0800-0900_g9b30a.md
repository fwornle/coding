**User Message:** I'm not convinced that your "pattern matching" is the right way to go. Seems prone to false positives. Would a lean git analysis not be a useful indicator - i. e. if a node has not been updated since X and we had more than a few commits which touch the code associated with the node (that's for a cheap and low-latency LLM to find out based on the content of the node - possibly using serena if this can be baked into the agent - or just one of the cheap Groq based models... or an embedding?), then ...
