**User Message:** There is an issue that you always stumble over:\
The command works but the Graph DB is locked. Let me test creating an entity using the SQLite fallback or stop all VKB processes:\
... (a) what SQLite fallback?! There should be no such thing! If there is, remove it and replace by an error message. We do not want fallbacks!\
(b) you often claim that vkb holds a lock on the DB (graphology and/or LevelDB - probably the latter?) and that you first have to stop vkb. Why? What is this lock for and why ...

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: T...
