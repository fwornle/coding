Warmup

### Assistant

I'm ready to help you search through the coding codebase. I can help you find files, search code contents, and analyze the structure of your project.

What would you like me to search for? Some examples of what I can do:

- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., "find all TypeScript files in src/")
- Search for specific code patterns or text (e.g., "find all uses of GraphDatabaseService")
- Locate configuration files or documentation
- Analyze directory structures
- Find files related to specific features or components

Just let me know what you're looking for and how thoroughly you'd like me to search (quick overview vs. deep dive).
