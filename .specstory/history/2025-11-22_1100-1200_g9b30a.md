**User Message:** you now appear to have deleted a bunch of ukb-related png-files (see git changes set - you also seem to have touched ukb-cli artifacts... you do realize that we still use ukb-cli(-unified?) across many products. We did NOT want to remove the cli... just the shell frontend command "ukb"!!! double check and make sure you fully understand where ukb-cli(-unified?) is used (via serena). ultrathink

**User Message:** done - start by fixing the pattern of the offending rule and re-enabling the rule. then find out why my "OVERRIDE_CONSTRAINT: plantuml-standard-styling" did not temporarily disable the constraint (as expected - this is what this option has been designed for. Analyze and fix, ultrathink, use serena to understand the code). Then proceed with all the tasks I have given you, in the order latest requests first, then going back until you have done them all
