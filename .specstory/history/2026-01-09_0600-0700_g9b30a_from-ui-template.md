**User Request:** a friend, Pete, has tried to install coding (from a fresh checkout)... and it seems to have "destroyed" his regular claude installation. The error states something with libsimdjson.26.dylib - check, if such an artifact is used somewhere (maybe in the sub-repos/integrations/node packages?) Perform a web search to find this artifact and its use. Try to install coding on a fresh test clone of the repos. If it doesn't install without any errors, analyze and fix. ultrathink. use serena to understand the installation code. Also check that scripts/testcoding.sh fully works

**User Request:** a friend, Pete, has tried to install coding (from a fresh checkout)... and it seems to have "destroyed" his regular claude installation. The error states something with libsimdjson.26.dylib - check, if such an artifact is used somewhere (maybe in the sub-repos/integrations/node packages?) Perform a web search to find this artifact and its use. Try to install coding on a fresh test clone of the repos. If it doesn't install without any errors, analyze and fix. ultrathink. use serena to understand the installation code. Also check that scripts/testcoding.sh fully works

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
