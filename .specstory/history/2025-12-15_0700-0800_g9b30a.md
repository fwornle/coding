Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Request**: User ran `/sl` (session logs) command to read session history for continuity. I read multiple session logs from the coding project.

2. **Session Summary Provided**: I summarized recent work:

**User Message:** Warmup

**Assistant Response:** I'm ready to assist you with code search and analysis tasks in the `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding` repository. I understand the critical constraints and guidelines:

**Key Rules I'm Following:**
- READ-ONLY mode only - no file modifications, creation, or deletion
- NO parallel versions or evolutionary naming (v2, v3, etc.)
- NO Serena MCP tools for code modifications - Serena is analysis-only
- ALWAYS verify results before reporting success
- Use efficient search patterns with Glob/Grep/Read too...
