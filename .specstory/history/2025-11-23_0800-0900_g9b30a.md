I guess, at least the UKB path changed somewhat - it is "manually triggered update" (you don't manually input anything anymore, I think - or can you? (use serena to understand what ukb can do and how it works)

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations
