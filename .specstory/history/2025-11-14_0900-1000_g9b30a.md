Warmup

### Assistant

I'll help you search through your codebase. I'm ready to use glob patterns, grep searches, and file reading to find what you need.

What would you like me to search for? You can ask me to:
- Find files matching certain patterns
- Search for specific code or text
- Read and analyze particular files
- Explore directory structures

Please let me know what you're looking for and how thorough you'd like me to be.
