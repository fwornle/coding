### Bash - 2026-01-21 06:57:10 UTC [07:57:10 CEST]

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

---

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",
  "description": "Get current working directory"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding

3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection

**Begin by identifying the current project and loading the most recent LSL file.**

### Bash - 2026-01-21 06:57:10 UTC [07:57:10 CEST]

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

**User Request:** # Session Logs (/sl) - Session Continuity Command

Load and summarize recent Live Session Logs (LSL) to provide continuity from previous work sessions.

## Instructions

**Goal**: Load recent LSL files and produce a summary to establish context continuity.

### Step 1: Determine Current Project

1. Get the current working directory
2. Identify the project name (the directory name containing `.specstory/history`)
3. Note if this IS the `coding` project or a DIFFERENT project

### Step 2: Load LSL Files from Current Project

1. List files in `.specstory/history/` sorted by modification time (most recent first)
2. Load the **most recent** LSL file
3. Check file size/content length:
   - If file is **short** (less than 50KB or fewer than 500 lines of actual content), also load 1-2 previous files
   - "Short" means the session was brief and may not have enough context
4. Note the **timestamp range** from the oldest loaded file's filename (format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM`)

### Step 3: Load Coding Project LSL Files (Cross-Project Context)

**Only if current project is NOT `coding`:**

1. Check `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/` for LSL files
2. Find files that fall within or overlap the timestamp range from Step 2
3. Load the most recent coding LSL file from that time range
4. If that file is short, also load 1-2 previous files from coding

**If current project IS `coding`:** Skip this step (already handled in Step 2)

### Step 4: Produce Summary

Create a concise summary covering:

1. **Time Range**: When these sessions occurred
2. **Projects Involved**: Which projects had activity
3. **Key Topics/Tasks**: Main things worked on in each session
4. **Current State**: What was left in progress or recently completed
5. **Suggested Next Steps**: Any obvious continuity items

Format the summary as:

```
## Session Continuity Summary

**Time Range**: [oldest file date] to [newest file date]
**Projects**: [list of projects with activity]

### Recent Work:
- [Project A]: [Brief description of main tasks]
- [Project B]: [Brief description of main tasks]

### Current State:
[What was in progress or just completed]

### Suggested Continuity:
[Any obvious next steps or items to pick up]
```

## File Selection Logic

- **Primary criterion**: Recency (most recent first)
- **Secondary criterion**: Length (short files trigger loading more files)
- **Tertiary criterion**: Cross-project relevance (coding project files during same timeframe)

## Size Thresholds

- **Short file**: < 50KB or < 500 lines → load additional files
- **Medium file**: 50KB-200KB → sufficient context alone
- **Large file**: > 200KB → definitely sufficient, may want to focus on recent sections

## Path Constants

- Current project LSL: `.specstory/history/`
- Coding project LSL: `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/`

## User Arguments

If user provides `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Number (e.g., "3"): Load exactly that many recent files per project
- "all": Load all files from today
- Empty/default: Use automatic length-based detection
