**User Message:** '/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/.specstory/history/2025-10-26_1300-1400_g9b30a.md' this fil has also been mis-classified ... and it would have been possible to know this by checking if this is a locally stored file or if it exists in coding:\
 docs/images/viewer.png\
--> review the change we recently made on the misclassification with LSLs that mention paths without explicit "coding" (but you could still find out from the local path and the path pre-pended with "coding/"

**User Message:** '/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/curriculum-alignment/.specstory/history/2025-10-24_1400-1500_g9b30a.md' LSLs such as this one bear no useful information (just warmup, "user interrupted", etc.) and, as such should be removed when the LSL window is closed

**User Message:** not sure this "heuristic" classification is correct - why is "<500" a <USER_ID_REDACTED> indicator? You need to check if you have ONLY worthless content, i. e. ONLY warmup + user interruptions
