**User Message:** check the documentation and consolidate/update where needed - instead of line art use mermaid or plantuml (with our own puml/_standard-style.puml) then turn to png's (in images) and include in md's. There might still be the old knowledge-management system documentation (11-agent system?). Are those two system parallel implementations now? Or has the new one replaced the old one? Are there any agents in the new one? Add graps (classes, architecture, sequence diagrams) where needed.
