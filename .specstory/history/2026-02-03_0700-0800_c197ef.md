### Write - 2026-02-03 06:04:21 UTC [07:04:21 CEST]

**User Request:** express (early in the article) that this is an experiment to create truly useful software in a 100% vibe coding approach. Also express that some parts of this project are still under development and need refining before delivering their full potential. But there is a lot of structure and content which might be useful to some as a basis for further/similar development in this area. A new strand of open-source might be useful fragments which one can easily fork and - with the help of coding agents - turn into whatever is needed. The age of custom made software is approaching.
Also take out weird specifics (eg. that there's been a design target of 8.33$ a month - this has always been a hallucination in the code which you now added to this article. And - those quotes of "Mem0 raised $24M for portable AI memory. Letta raised $10M for stateful agents. The industry knows this is a problem worth solving." - where did you take them from. If you keep such quotes, we need to reference the source.
Also, in the intro, rather than only focussing on the "amnesia" aspect (which is valid) also add the goal of making scalable teams of senior developers possible, who have access to the collective experience and project/product context information of your entire team/teams... buiding a "collective brain" for coding agents.

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json
{<AWS_CREDENTIALS_REDACTED>}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
The file <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>m-article.md has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:

### Write - 2026-02-03 06:04:21 UTC [07:04:21 CEST]

**User Request:** express (early in the article) that this is an experiment to create truly useful software in a 100% vibe coding approach. Also express that some parts of this project are still under development and need refining before delivering their full potential. But there is a lot of structure and content which might be useful to some as a basis for further/similar development in this area. A new strand of open-source might be useful fragments which one can easily fork and - with the help of coding agents - turn into whatever is needed. The age of custom made software is approaching.
Also take out weird specifics (eg. that there's been a design target of 8.33$ a month - this has always been a hallucination in the code which you now added to this article. And - those quotes of "Mem0 raised $24M for portable AI memory. Letta raised $10M for stateful agents. The industry knows this is a problem worth solving." - where did you take them from. If you keep such quotes, we need to reference the source.
Also, in the intro, rather than only focussing on the "amnesia" aspect (which is valid) also add the goal of making scalable teams of senior developers possible, who have access to the collective experience and project/product context information of your entire team/teams... buiding a "collective brain" for coding agents.

**Tool:** Write
