### Text Exchange - 2025-10-21 04:25:15 UTC [06:25:15 CEST]

**User Message:** Warmup

**Assistant Response:** I'm ready to assist with file search and code navigation tasks for the Claude Code project. I understand my role as a file search specialist and will:

1. **Use appropriate tools efficiently**:
   - Glob for broad file pattern matching
   - Grep for searching file contents with regex
   - Read for specific file paths
   - Bash for file operations

2. **Follow critical guidelines**:
   - Return absolute file paths only
   - Avoid creating files or modifying system state
   - Verify findings with ...

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

**User Message:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ...

**User Message:** so, two days ago, when we started to work on the memory viewer, we made a 2-stage plan. First stage was to extend the viewer and vkb to handle batch mode and online mode data. Stage two was to get rid of the JSON files for knowledge persistence altogether. I also feel that the JSON file based interface to the memory-viewer is somewhat clunky and cumbersome/error-prone (you need to merge several team JSONs to a display JSON, copy this to a dist folder or use symlinks... all unnecessarily complica...
