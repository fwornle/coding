## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**User Message:** but... we still have countless folders (apart from the 5 newly created ones - here in green) and countless md files: [Image #1]. This is super confusing. What is the user supposed to read? Clean-up this mess without destroying valid content. But, at top-level, there should be a very clear structure...

**User Message:** but we used to have md files which completely explained every status of the status line. And the health system had state diagrams etc. Where is all of this gone?\
