### Text Exchange - 2026-01-07 09:07:52 UTC [10:07:52 CEST]

**User Message:** the 5s remaining has been displayed for minutes now. Given that we're at 81% with a total duration of 10 mins, the remaining 20% should be on the order of 2 mins (if things are linear) --> the learning of steps etc. seems incorrect. I suspect, you worked out an average batch step duration and multiplied this by 24 (for 24 steps). As you go through steps and have actual durations, you should correct the ETA. Analyze and come up with a better model

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
