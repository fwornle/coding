### TodoWrite - 2026-01-06 07:16:58 UTC [08:16:58 CEST]

**User Request:** extend the entire health board code to use the Logger class. I want to be able to see information of what's happening in this web app at all levels (from error/warn to info to debug and trace). Choose appropriate classes to configure the system. Integrate the configuration modal as well as the persistent storage of user choices in the browser (see ui-template and the docs in this project). Add a Logger config button to the right of the Constraint Dashboard button to allow the user to bring up the Logger config modal\
ultrathink. use serena to fully understand the code of the dashboard (both the main screen as well as the WF modal and the CGR refresh modals)

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json

### Edit - 2026-01-06 07:16:58 UTC [08:16:58 CEST]

**User Request:** extend the entire health board code to use the Logger class. I want to be able to see information of what's happening in this web app at all levels (from error/warn to info to debug and trace). Choose appropriate classes to configure the system. Integrate the configuration modal as well as the persistent storage of user choices in the browser (see ui-template and the docs in this project). Add a Logger config button to the right of the Constraint Dashboard button to allow the user to bring up the Logger config modal\
ultrathink. use serena to fully understand the code of the dashboard (both the main screen as well as the WF modal and the CGR refresh modals)

### Edit - 2026-01-06 07:16:58 UTC [08:16:58 CEST]

**User Request:** extend the entire health board code to use the Logger class. I want to be able to see information of what's happening in this web app at all levels (from error/warn to info to debug and trace). Choose appropriate classes to configure the system. Integrate the configuration modal as well as the persistent storage of user choices in the browser (see ui-template and the docs in this project). Add a Logger config button to the right of the Constraint Dashboard button to allow the user to bring up the Logger config modal\
ultrathink. use serena to fully understand the code of the dashboard (both the main screen as well as the WF modal and the CGR refresh modals)
