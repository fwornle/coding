  "new_str": "      cleanedSessions[projectName] = sessionData;\n    }\n\n    // SHUTDOWN CLEANUP: Remove sessions where agent process has exited\n    // When a user shuts down a coding session, it should disappear from the\n    // statusline immediately — not linger as \"cooling down\" based on transcript age\n    const liveSessions = {};\n    for (const [projectName, sessionData] of Object.entries(cleanedSessions)) {\n      const hasRunningAgent = agentSessions.has(projectName);\n\n      if (hasRunningAgent || sessionData.status === 'no-monitor') {\n        // Agent is running, or already handled as no-monitor — keep\n        liveSessions[projectName] = sessionData;\n      } else {\n        this.log(`Removed closed session ${projectName} from statusline (agent not running, was: ${sessionData.status})`, 'DEBUG');\n      }\n    }\n\n    return liveSessions;\n  }"
