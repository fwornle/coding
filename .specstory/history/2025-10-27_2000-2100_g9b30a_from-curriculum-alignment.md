## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-10-27 19:04:05 UTC [20:04:05 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Message:** '/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-10-27_1700-1800_g9b30a.md' - latest fix (presumably) has led to weird "repetitive" LSL files (referenced file is but one example). Analyze why this is happening - use serena and ultrathink. Debug this and fix. Then reclassify (batch mode) to see if it all works as expected now.

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

**User Message:** implement a whitelist for this constraint, so we can deal with this obvious case where we had already created an "evolutionary name" before the constraint got introduced. Then add coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js to this whitelist and ensure that the contstraint mentions the whitelisting as allowed exemptions.\
Once this has been fixed, continue with the fix of the LSL system
