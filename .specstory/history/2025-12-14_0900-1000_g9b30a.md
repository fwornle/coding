**User Message:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Context (from previous session)**:
   - Previous work involved daemon robustness mechanisms (heartbeat, watchdog)
   - Documentation was updated with PlantUML diagrams

2. **User Request about UKB Workflow Issues**:
   - User showed a screenshot of the Knowledge Graph visualization at localhost:8080
  ...

**User Message:** update the docs with these changes (md, puml/png - both in the main text as well as presentation mode). Have you also updated the monitor dashboard to reflect this new agent system structure? Is it still a 13-agent system?

# Documentation Styling Rules

This skill enforces comprehensive documentation standards across all projects.

## Critical Rules

### 1. NO LINE ART - EVER
**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Never create ASCII art or line-based diagrams in documentation.

**ALWAYS USE**:
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, component diagrams
- Mermaid for flowcharts, state diagrams, simple visualizations

**WHY**: T...

**User Message:** only 3 LLM powered nodes? What about Observations, Web Search, Vibe and Git history? Validation? Ontology? De-Duplication? The mcp server "Code Graph"? ... In my head, they should all use LLMs to do semantic work (otherwise they'll be crap and probably don't work at all). ultrathink. use serena to understand the codebase associated with each agent. Then update the docs and diagrams accordingly. And make sure the details of the ukb graph on the dashboard are consistent with the result of this ana...

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context (from previous session summary)**:
   - User had identified issues with UKB workflow producing meaningless entities like "ArchitecturalEvolutionPattern"
   - Four explicit requests were made: (a) semantic analysis of git commits, (b) remove meaningless nodes via QA agent, (c) improve workflow v...

**User Message:** you stated that:\
  Agents WITHOUT LLM:
  - GitHistoryAgent (disabled)
  - WebSearchAgent (unused SemanticAnalyzer)
  - OntologyClassificationAgent (disabled)
  - DocumentationLinkerAgent (none)
  - PersistenceAgent (disabled)\
--> why are some of those agents disabled? And why are they not using LLMs? apart from the last one (Persistence) I would have expected all of those to use LLMs too. Analyze and fix. Use serena to comprehend the code. ultrathink+
