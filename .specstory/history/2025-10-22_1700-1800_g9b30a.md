### Text Exchange - 2025-10-22 15:27:29 UTC [17:27:29 CEST]

**User Message:** '/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/operations/knowledge-system-ops.md' - revisit this document. Is this still up-to-date? It still claims that the graph DB is purely used for the batch mode knowledge-managent (ukb/vkb)... which does not seem to be true / in line with the now corrected documentation. Is the embedded graph "service dependencies" correct? how about the text?

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
