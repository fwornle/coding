### TodoWrite - 2025-12-16 06:07:11 UTC [07:07:11 CEST]

**User Request:** still running (?)... and all the steps took mere seconds and the code-graph-rag server has been skipped. Check the logs why. Debug and trace systematically. ultrathink. use serena to undersatend the mcp-server-semantic-analysis.\
Expectation:\
(1) the DAG reflects exactly what happens in the agent, including coordinator and loops (with ordinate numbers showing how many times we went round the loop, if any\
(2) rough logical sequence: (a:) fetch git analysis (commit messages, touched file diffs), (b:) fetch corresponding vibe history (LSL files), (c:) full AST analysis of entire codebase (code-graph-rag), (d:) read associated docs, (d) combine these 4 pieces of information to semantically understand what we were trying to do (from b) and how we did it (a with c and d) - the result are the key building blocks which make up the repo. (e:) derive deeper insights (key architecture patterns used, sample solutions of how we solved various aspects, ...) and produce md-reports from a template (see current insights in knowledge-mamagement/insights) - these include puml/png's where helpful. (f:) genereate summary ovservations for the knowledge graph node, (g:) classify the nodes using the ontology system, (h:) run QA and fix whatever is not fully up to our standards, (i:) persist, (j:) deduplicate graph, (k:) overall validation\
Everything is logged. The DAG viewer details shows what's going on (stats: runtime, tokens, files, insights, ...), incl. the result summary (and result details upon clicking on the stats).

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json

  "todos": [

**User Message:** also, if the code-graph-rag code analysis is this slow for large code bases, can we maybe run the indexing offline first and have a mechanism that decides when full re-indexing is needed (not in every ukb run, I presume - hopefully, there is an incremental indexing mechanism?)
