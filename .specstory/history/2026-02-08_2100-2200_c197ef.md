**User Request:** so now I started another session (copilot) - where is this one... and why is coding "cooling down" - and why has I9 already been removed? (I didn't close this session yet... if it got fully cooled down - but should it have? after such a short time of inactivity? - ... you should have shown it as zzz. Re-read the statusline docs. Check the code and fix this

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
