### Text Exchange - 2025-11-24 05:51:03 UTC [06:51:03 CEST]

**User Message:** 1. are you trying other models (Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI) when Groq fails? I thought we had a cadence of LLMs we try in order of suitability/price?\
4. Is the stale hardcoded entry in the knowledge base (? what does this even mean... hardcoded how?) possibly a remainder of a not yet correctly implemented deletion mechanism? (we introduced this recently, but I'm not sure if actually deletes it from graphology --> LevelDB --> JSON export or if it only "half deletes it"

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

**User Message:** 1. yes, and indicate it in the API section of the status Line\
2. find out how the deletion of entities works then (viewer has recently be extended to allow for the deletion of entities --> how is it doing this, if there is no method in GraphDatabaseService? Is this the issue that it does an incomplete deletion and this has led to the "hardcoded" (?!) entities - explain what you mean with hardcoded when referring to a DB entry. Where is the code you are referring to?\
3. yes
