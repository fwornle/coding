### mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed - 2025-11-21 05:35:34 UTC [06:35:34 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Request:** I have noticed that the "corporate network detection" which is used to switch from/to "sensitive" pages does not fully work. When clicking on the link on the concise coder settings page ('/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/corporate-only/00_intro/coder-concise.md') the detailed page is shown ('/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/corporate-only/00_intro/coder-detailed.md'), but it disappears after a second - the system switches back to the concise page.\
Note that sensitive pages are kept in a separate (private) repo and, upon building the published version on github pages (mkdoc pages), this repo is fetched and the senstivie pages are encrypted. When the corporate network detector sees that we are in the CN it decrypts the page and displays it instead of the public corresponding variant. ultrathink. use serena to analyze the code. fix it

**User Request:** I have noticed that the "corporate network detection" which is used to switch from/to "sensitive" pages does not fully work. When clicking on the link on the concise coder settings page ('/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/corporate-only/00_intro/coder-concise.md') the detailed page is shown ('/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/corporate-only/00_intro/coder-detailed.md'), but it disappears after a second - the system switches back to the concise page.\
Note that sensitive pages are kept in a separate (private) repo and, upon building the published version on github pages (mkdoc pages), this repo is fetched and the senstivie pages are encrypted. When the corporate network detector sees that we are in the CN it decrypts the page and displays it instead of the public corresponding variant. ultrathink. use serena to analyze the code. fix it

Old loader (corporate-content-loader.js) was running 3 seconds after page\n   load and replacing detailed content with concise primary content. Added\n   checks to disable old loader when unified system is active.\n\n2. Unified system's MutationObserver was reinitializing on hash changes,\n   which caused it to reload primary (concise) content. Modified observer\n   to only reinitialize on pathname changes, not hash changes.\n\nThe hash change handler now properly controls detailed content switching\nwithout interference from reinitialization or old loader.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://<CONNECTION_STRING_REDACTED>
