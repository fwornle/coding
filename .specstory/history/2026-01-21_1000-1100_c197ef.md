  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

These visual smoothing improvements make\ntransitions appear less jarring when multiple steps complete between polls.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <<EMAIL_REDACTED>>\nEOF\n)\"",

These visual smoothing improvements make\ntransitions appear less jarring when multiple steps complete between polls.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <<EMAIL_REDACTED>>\nEOF\n)\"",

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.                              
                                                                                                                                         
  Cont                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                         
  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment

  ⏺ Health verifier is now HEALTHY (10 checks passed, 0 violations). The fix is working. Refresh the dashboard to see the updated        
  status.                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                         
  Now regarding the "jumping" issue - the fundamental problem is that workflow steps complete faster than we can poll. Even at           
  500ms,                                                                                                                                 
  some steps finish in milliseconds. The workflow completes several batches per second in free-flight mode.

  Would you like me to:                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                         
  1. Keep 500ms polling - Best balance of responsiveness vs performance                         Con                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  2. Add visual smoothing - Animate transitions between states so it looks smoother                                                      
                                                                                                                                         
  3. Accept current behavior - The graph accurately shows completed steps, it just can't catch every brief "running" moment
