Warmup

### Assistant

I'll help you search through the codebase. I'm ready to navigate and explore files using glob patterns, grep searches, and file reading as needed.

What would you like me to search for? For example, I can:

- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., "Find all TypeScript files in the src directory")
- Search for specific code patterns or text (e.g., "Find all functions that use the knowledge graph")
- Locate and read specific configuration files
- Explore directory structures
- Search for specific imports, function calls, or code patterns

Just let me know what you're looking for and I'll conduct a thorough search based on your needs.
