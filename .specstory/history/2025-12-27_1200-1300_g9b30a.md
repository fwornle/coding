### Grep - 2025-12-27 11:08:45 UTC [12:08:45 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: This was a continuation session focused on fixing DAG visualization issues in the UKB Workflow Monitor dashboard on port 3032.

2. **First User Feedback**: User reported layout still broken with overlapping nodes, Batch overlapping with other elements, and arrows not connecting properly.

3. **Layout Algorithm Changes**: 
   - Initially implemented a dynamic topological sort algorithm which created linear chains instead of parallel nodes
   - User complained about Git/Vibe not being side-by-side
   - Simplified to preserve original row/col positions from agents.yaml
   - Added row normalization to remove gaps

4. **Position Updates in agents.yaml**:
   - batch_scheduler: changed multiple times, finally to row=-0.5, col=0.6
   - git_history: col=0.25 (left of center)
   - vibe_history: col=0.95 (right of center)
   - All single agents (semantic, kg_operators, qa, checkpoint, persist, dedup, validate): col=0.6
   - orchestrator: col=0.6

5. **Edge Rendering Fix**:
   - Changed from `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` to `visibleAgents.find()` for proper normalized positions
   - This was causing edges to draw to wrong locations

6. **Arrow Fixes**:
   - Normal arrows: Added vertical final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
   - Loop-back arrows: Added horizontal final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY}`

7. **Vertical Spacing**:
   - Increased verticalGap from 15 to 40 to 60

8. **Most Recent Issue**: User pointed out spacing between batch and adjacent steps differs from other steps - caused by fractional row (-0.5) not being normalized

9. **Final Fix**: Changed normalization to include ALL rows (including negative), mapping them to consecutive integers starting from 0.

Key files modified:
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Fix the UKB Workflow Monitor DAG visualization layout for the batch-analysis workflow
   - Ensure all nodes form a centered column with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Fix arrow/arrowhead connections for curved paths (both normal and loop-back arrows)
   - Make vertical spacing uniform between ALL steps (no fractional row spacing differences)
   - Center the workflow header (batch-analysis/orchestrator) above the centered column

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - SVG-based DAG workflow visualization with React
   - Row/column grid positioning with normalization
   - Bezier curve path generation for edges with proper arrowhead alignment
   - HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for live dashboard updates
   - Single Source of Truth pattern (agents.yaml defines positions, API serves them)
   - Row normalization to consecutive integers for uniform spacing

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`**
     - Main workflow graph component - renders nodes and edges
     
     **Row normalization (most recent fix):**
     ```javascript
     // Normalize ALL row numbers to consecutive integers (e.g., rows -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4 → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
     // This ensures equal spacing between ALL rows regardless of original values
     const uniqueRows = [...new Set(filtered.map(a => a.row))].sort((a, b) => a - b)
     const rowMap = new Map<number, number>()

     // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
     uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
       rowMap.set(row, index)
     })
     ```
     
     **Vertical gap increased:**
     ```javascript
     const verticalGap = 60  // Increased for fractional row spacing
     ```
     
     **Edge rendering fix (use visibleAgents not WORKFLOW_AGENTS):**
     ```javascript
     // Handle orchestrator as source - use visibleAgents for normalized positions
     const fromAgent = edge.from === 'orchestrator'
       ? ORCHESTRATOR_NODE
       : visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.from)
     const toAgent = visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.to)
     ```
     
     **Normal arrow path with vertical approach:**
     ```javascript
     // Path with vertical final approach for proper arrowhead alignment
     const approachY = toY - 15  // Point above target for vertical approach
     const midY = (fromY + approachY) / 2
     path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY} C ${fromX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${approachY} L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
     ```
     
     **Loop-back arrow path with horizontal approach:**
     ```javascript
     if (isLoopBack) {
       // Loop-back path: curve to the left and up with horizontal final approach
       const leftOffset = 50  // How far left to curve
       const approachX = toX - 12  // Point for horizontal approach to target
       path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY}
               C ${fromX - leftOffset} ${fromY},
                 ${approachX - leftOffset} ${toY},
                 ${approachX} ${toY} L ${toX} ${toY}`
     }
     ```
     
     **Orchestrator position:**
     ```javascript
     const ORCHESTRATOR_NODE = {
       ...
       row: -1,  // Above all other nodes
       col: 0.6,  // Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     }
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`**
     - Single source of truth for agent definitions and positions
     
     **Key position updates:**
     ```yaml
     orchestrator:
       row: -1
       col: 0.6         # Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     
     batch_scheduler:
       row: -0.5       # Between orchestrator and main flow
       col: 0.6        # Centered in column
     
     git_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.25       # Left of center, adjacent to Vibe
     
     vibe_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.95       # Right of center, adjacent to Git
     
     # All single agents at col: 0.6
     semantic_analysis: row: 1, col: 0.6
     kg_operators: row: 4, col: 0.6
     quality_assurance: row: 6, col: 0.6
     batch_checkpoint_manager: row: 6.5, col: 0.6
     persistence: row: 7, col: 0.6
     deduplication: row: 8, col: 0.6
     content_validation: row: 9, col: 0.6
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`**
     - Updated edges to make git and vibe parallel:
     ```yaml
     # Batch extraction (parallel: both git and vibe receive batch info)
     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: git_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     # Data flow: vibe uses commits from git (but visually parallel)
     - from: git_history
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "commits"
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Dynamic layout created linear chain**: Topological sort algorithm made nodes sequential. Fixed by preserving original positions from agents.yaml.
   - **Batch overlapping with Git/Vibe**: row=-0.5 too close to row=0. Fixed by increasing verticalGap and later normalizing all rows.
   - **Edges drawn to wrong positions**: Used `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` which had original positions instead of normalized. Fixed by using `visibleAgents.find()`.
   - **Curved arrow arrowheads disconnected**: Path end tangent not aligned with target. Fixed by adding straight final approach segments (vertical for normal, horizontal for loop-back).
   - **Unequal spacing around batch**: Negative rows not being normalized. Fixed by normalizing ALL rows to consecutive integers.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved: Centered column layout with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Solved: Arrow paths now have proper approach angles for arrowhead connection
   - Solved: Orchestrator centered above the column
   - In Progress: Equal spacing between all rows (just implemented normalization fix)

6. All user messages:
   - "now we have everything vertically aligned. Parallel steps (code, vibe) must be next to one another (same height). batch seems to be a node like 'coordinator'. Should this not be next to the main graph and get some feedback from some other step which triggers the next batch? Also, the arrows are now all over the place."
   - "almost - only batch remains a problem child (vibe in front of it --> batch-analysis & batch need shifted. Also KG-Ops is not connected to anything in the graph"
   - "the arrows are hard to read as you failed to sufficiently space out the steps verticaly"
   - "why can you not have batch-analysis, batch, semantic, KG-Ops and everything that follows be center-aligned (so they form a column). This column should embed the parallel steps git and vibe (so that the right edge of git coincides with the left edge of vibe and this coincidental line is on the center line of the entiere column. Also, the arrows only (by chance) work for vertical arrow lines - all curved arrow lines fail to connect their arrow-head sided end to the broad part of the arrow triangle"
   - "almost - just batch analysis needs to be centered above batch and batch and git/vibe must not overlap (more vertical space needed around batch. Plus you failed to fix the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> arrow (same issue with the arrow-head connection)"
   - "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Verify the final row normalization fix resolves the unequal spacing issue

8. Current Work:
   The most recent work was fixing unequal vertical spacing between batch and its adjacent steps. The user said: "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"
   
   I fixed this by changing the row normalization to include ALL rows (including negative ones like -1 and -0.5), mapping them to consecutive integers:
   ```javascript
   // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
   uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
     rowMap.set(row, index)
   })
   ```
   
   This ensures rows like -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 9 become 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with equal spacing between all.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Verify the dashboard renders correctly with equal spacing between all rows. The user should refresh the dashboard at http://localhost:3032 to confirm the fix works. HMR should have already applied the changes..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

   - **Batch overlapping with Git/Vibe**: row=-0.5 too close to row=0. Fixed by increasing verticalGap and later normalizing all rows.
   - **Edges drawn to wrong positions**: Used `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` which had original positions instead of normalized. Fixed by using `visibleAgents.find()`.
   - **Curved arrow arrowheads disconnected**: Path end tangent not aligned with target. Fixed by adding straight final approach segments (vertical for normal, horizontal for loop-back).
   - **Unequal spacing around batch**: Negative rows not being normalized. Fixed by normalizing ALL rows to consecutive integers.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved: Centered column layout with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Solved: Arrow paths now have proper approach angles for arrowhead connection
   - Solved: Orchestrator centered above the column
   - In Progress: Equal spacing between all rows (just implemented normalization fix)

6. All user messages:
   - "now we have everything vertically aligned. Parallel steps (code, vibe) must be next to one another (same height). batch seems to be a node like 'coordinator'. Should this not be next to the main graph and get some feedback from some other step which triggers the next batch? Also, the arrows are now all over the place."
   - "almost - only batch remains a problem child (vibe in front of it --> batch-analysis & batch need shifted. Also KG-Ops is not connected to anything in the graph"
   - "the arrows are hard to read as you failed to sufficiently space out the steps verticaly"
   - "why can you not have batch-analysis, batch, semantic, KG-Ops and everything that follows be center-aligned (so they form a column). This column should embed the parallel steps git and vibe (so that the right edge of git coincides with the left edge of vibe and this coincidental line is on the center line of the entiere column. Also, the arrows only (by chance) work for vertical arrow lines - all curved arrow lines fail to connect their arrow-head sided end to the broad part of the arrow triangle"
   - "almost - just batch analysis needs to be centered above batch and batch and git/vibe must not overlap (more vertical space needed around batch. Plus you failed to fix the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> arrow (same issue with the arrow-head connection)"
   - "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Verify the final row normalization fix resolves the unequal spacing issue

8. Current Work:
   The most recent work was fixing unequal vertical spacing between batch and its adjacent steps. The user said: "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"
   
   I fixed this by changing the row normalization to include ALL rows (including negative ones like -1 and -0.5), mapping them to consecutive integers:
   ```javascript
   // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
   uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
     rowMap.set(row, index)
   })
   ```
   
   This ensures rows like -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 9 become 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with equal spacing between all.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Verify the dashboard renders correctly with equal spacing between all rows. The user should refresh the dashboard at http://localhost:3032 to confirm the fix works. HMR should have already applied the changes..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Grep - 2025-12-27 11:08:45 UTC [12:08:45 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: This was a continuation session focused on fixing DAG visualization issues in the UKB Workflow Monitor dashboard on port 3032.

2. **First User Feedback**: User reported layout still broken with overlapping nodes, Batch overlapping with other elements, and arrows not connecting properly.

3. **Layout Algorithm Changes**: 
   - Initially implemented a dynamic topological sort algorithm which created linear chains instead of parallel nodes
   - User complained about Git/Vibe not being side-by-side
   - Simplified to preserve original row/col positions from agents.yaml
   - Added row normalization to remove gaps

4. **Position Updates in agents.yaml**:
   - batch_scheduler: changed multiple times, finally to row=-0.5, col=0.6
   - git_history: col=0.25 (left of center)
   - vibe_history: col=0.95 (right of center)
   - All single agents (semantic, kg_operators, qa, checkpoint, persist, dedup, validate): col=0.6
   - orchestrator: col=0.6

5. **Edge Rendering Fix**:
   - Changed from `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` to `visibleAgents.find()` for proper normalized positions
   - This was causing edges to draw to wrong locations

6. **Arrow Fixes**:
   - Normal arrows: Added vertical final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
   - Loop-back arrows: Added horizontal final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY}`

7. **Vertical Spacing**:
   - Increased verticalGap from 15 to 40 to 60

8. **Most Recent Issue**: User pointed out spacing between batch and adjacent steps differs from other steps - caused by fractional row (-0.5) not being normalized

9. **Final Fix**: Changed normalization to include ALL rows (including negative), mapping them to consecutive integers starting from 0.

Key files modified:
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Fix the UKB Workflow Monitor DAG visualization layout for the batch-analysis workflow
   - Ensure all nodes form a centered column with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Fix arrow/arrowhead connections for curved paths (both normal and loop-back arrows)
   - Make vertical spacing uniform between ALL steps (no fractional row spacing differences)
   - Center the workflow header (batch-analysis/orchestrator) above the centered column

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - SVG-based DAG workflow visualization with React
   - Row/column grid positioning with normalization
   - Bezier curve path generation for edges with proper arrowhead alignment
   - HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for live dashboard updates
   - Single Source of Truth pattern (agents.yaml defines positions, API serves them)
   - Row normalization to consecutive integers for uniform spacing

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`**
     - Main workflow graph component - renders nodes and edges
     
     **Row normalization (most recent fix):**
     ```javascript
     // Normalize ALL row numbers to consecutive integers (e.g., rows -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4 → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
     // This ensures equal spacing between ALL rows regardless of original values
     const uniqueRows = [...new Set(filtered.map(a => a.row))].sort((a, b) => a - b)
     const rowMap = new Map<number, number>()

     // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
     uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
       rowMap.set(row, index)
     })
     ```
     
     **Vertical gap increased:**
     ```javascript
     const verticalGap = 60  // Increased for fractional row spacing
     ```
     
     **Edge rendering fix (use visibleAgents not WORKFLOW_AGENTS):**
     ```javascript
     // Handle orchestrator as source - use visibleAgents for normalized positions
     const fromAgent = edge.from === 'orchestrator'
       ? ORCHESTRATOR_NODE
       : visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.from)
     const toAgent = visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.to)
     ```
     
     **Normal arrow path with vertical approach:**
     ```javascript
     // Path with vertical final approach for proper arrowhead alignment
     const approachY = toY - 15  // Point above target for vertical approach
     const midY = (fromY + approachY) / 2
     path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY} C ${fromX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${approachY} L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
     ```
     
     **Loop-back arrow path with horizontal approach:**
     ```javascript
     if (isLoopBack) {
       // Loop-back path: curve to the left and up with horizontal final approach
       const leftOffset = 50  // How far left to curve
       const approachX = toX - 12  // Point for horizontal approach to target
       path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY}
               C ${fromX - leftOffset} ${fromY},
                 ${approachX - leftOffset} ${toY},
                 ${approachX} ${toY} L ${toX} ${toY}`
     }
     ```
     
     **Orchestrator position:**
     ```javascript
     const ORCHESTRATOR_NODE = {
       ...
       row: -1,  // Above all other nodes
       col: 0.6,  // Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     }
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`**
     - Single source of truth for agent definitions and positions
     
     **Key position updates:**
     ```yaml
     orchestrator:
       row: -1
       col: 0.6         # Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     
     batch_scheduler:
       row: -0.5       # Between orchestrator and main flow
       col: 0.6        # Centered in column
     
     git_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.25       # Left of center, adjacent to Vibe
     
     vibe_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.95       # Right of center, adjacent to Git
     
     # All single agents at col: 0.6
     semantic_analysis: row: 1, col: 0.6
     kg_operators: row: 4, col: 0.6
     quality_assurance: row: 6, col: 0.6

     persistence: row: 7, col: 0.6
     deduplication: row: 8, col: 0.6
     content_validation: row: 9, col: 0.6
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`**
     - Updated edges to make git and vibe parallel:
     ```yaml
     # Batch extraction (parallel: both git and vibe receive batch info)
     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: git_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     # Data flow: vibe uses commits from git (but visually parallel)
     - from: git_history
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "commits"
     ```

   - "why can you not have batch-analysis, batch, semantic, KG-Ops and everything that follows be center-aligned (so they form a column). This column should embed the parallel steps git and vibe (so that the right edge of git coincides with the left edge of vibe and this coincidental line is on the center line of the entiere column. Also, the arrows only (by chance) work for vertical arrow lines - all curved arrow lines fail to connect their arrow-head sided end to the broad part of the arrow triangle"
   - "almost - just batch analysis needs to be centered above batch and batch and git/vibe must not overlap (more vertical space needed around batch. Plus you failed to fix the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> arrow (same issue with the arrow-head connection)"
   - "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Verify the final row normalization fix resolves the unequal spacing issue

8. Current Work:
   The most recent work was fixing unequal vertical spacing between batch and its adjacent steps. The user said: "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"
   
   I fixed this by changing the row normalization to include ALL rows (including negative ones like -1 and -0.5), mapping them to consecutive integers:
   ```javascript
   // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
   uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
     rowMap.set(row, index)
   })
   ```
   
   This ensures rows like -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 9 become 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with equal spacing between all.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Verify the dashboard renders correctly with equal spacing between all rows. The user should refresh the dashboard at http://localhost:3032 to confirm the fix works. HMR should have already applied the changes..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### mcp__browser-access__stagehand_navigate - 2025-12-27 11:08:45 UTC [12:08:45 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: This was a continuation session focused on fixing DAG visualization issues in the UKB Workflow Monitor dashboard on port 3032.

2. **First User Feedback**: User reported layout still broken with overlapping nodes, Batch overlapping with other elements, and arrows not connecting properly.

3. **Layout Algorithm Changes**: 
   - Initially implemented a dynamic topological sort algorithm which created linear chains instead of parallel nodes
   - User complained about Git/Vibe not being side-by-side
   - Simplified to preserve original row/col positions from agents.yaml
   - Added row normalization to remove gaps

4. **Position Updates in agents.yaml**:
   - batch_scheduler: changed multiple times, finally to row=-0.5, col=0.6
   - git_history: col=0.25 (left of center)
   - vibe_history: col=0.95 (right of center)
   - All single agents (semantic, kg_operators, qa, checkpoint, persist, dedup, validate): col=0.6
   - orchestrator: col=0.6

5. **Edge Rendering Fix**:
   - Changed from `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` to `visibleAgents.find()` for proper normalized positions
   - This was causing edges to draw to wrong locations

6. **Arrow Fixes**:
   - Normal arrows: Added vertical final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
   - Loop-back arrows: Added horizontal final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY}`

7. **Vertical Spacing**:
   - Increased verticalGap from 15 to 40 to 60

8. **Most Recent Issue**: User pointed out spacing between batch and adjacent steps differs from other steps - caused by fractional row (-0.5) not being normalized

9. **Final Fix**: Changed normalization to include ALL rows (including negative), mapping them to consecutive integers starting from 0.

Key files modified:
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Fix the UKB Workflow Monitor DAG visualization layout for the batch-analysis workflow
   - Ensure all nodes form a centered column with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Fix arrow/arrowhead connections for curved paths (both normal and loop-back arrows)
   - Make vertical spacing uniform between ALL steps (no fractional row spacing differences)
   - Center the workflow header (batch-analysis/orchestrator) above the centered column

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - SVG-based DAG workflow visualization with React
   - Row/column grid positioning with normalization
   - Bezier curve path generation for edges with proper arrowhead alignment
   - HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for live dashboard updates
   - Single Source of Truth pattern (agents.yaml defines positions, API serves them)
   - Row normalization to consecutive integers for uniform spacing

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`**
     - Main workflow graph component - renders nodes and edges
     
     **Row normalization (most recent fix):**
     ```javascript
     // Normalize ALL row numbers to consecutive integers (e.g., rows -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4 → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
     // This ensures equal spacing between ALL rows regardless of original values
     const uniqueRows = [...new Set(filtered.map(a => a.row))].sort((a, b) => a - b)
     const rowMap = new Map<number, number>()

     // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
     uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
       rowMap.set(row, index)
     })
     ```
     
     **Vertical gap increased:**
     ```javascript
     const verticalGap = 60  // Increased for fractional row spacing
     ```
     
     **Edge rendering fix (use visibleAgents not WORKFLOW_AGENTS):**
     ```javascript
     // Handle orchestrator as source - use visibleAgents for normalized positions
     const fromAgent = edge.from === 'orchestrator'
       ? ORCHESTRATOR_NODE
       : visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.from)
     const toAgent = visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.to)
     ```
     
     **Normal arrow path with vertical approach:**
     ```javascript
     // Path with vertical final approach for proper arrowhead alignment
     const approachY = toY - 15  // Point above target for vertical approach
     const midY = (fromY + approachY) / 2
     path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY} C ${fromX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${approachY} L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
     ```
     
     **Loop-back arrow path with horizontal approach:**
     ```javascript
     if (isLoopBack) {
       // Loop-back path: curve to the left and up with horizontal final approach
       const leftOffset = 50  // How far left to curve
       const approachX = toX - 12  // Point for horizontal approach to target
       path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY}
               C ${fromX - leftOffset} ${fromY},
                 ${approachX - leftOffset} ${toY},
                 ${approachX} ${toY} L ${toX} ${toY}`
     }
     ```
     
     **Orchestrator position:**
     ```javascript
     const ORCHESTRATOR_NODE = {
       ...
       row: -1,  // Above all other nodes
       col: 0.6,  // Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     }
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`**
     - Single source of truth for agent definitions and positions
     
     **Key position updates:**
     ```yaml
     orchestrator:
       row: -1
       col: 0.6         # Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     
     batch_scheduler:
       row: -0.5       # Between orchestrator and main flow
       col: 0.6        # Centered in column
     
     git_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.25       # Left of center, adjacent to Vibe
     
     vibe_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.95       # Right of center, adjacent to Git
     
     # All single agents at col: 0.6
     semantic_analysis: row: 1, col: 0.6
     kg_operators: row: 4, col: 0.6
     quality_assurance: row: 6, col: 0.6
     batch_checkpoint_manager: row: 6.5, col: 0.6
     persistence: row: 7, col: 0.6
     deduplication: row: 8, col: 0.6
     content_validation: row: 9, col: 0.6
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`**
     - Updated edges to make git and vibe parallel:
     ```yaml
     # Batch extraction (parallel: both git and vibe receive batch info)
     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: git_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     # Data flow: vibe uses commits from git (but visually parallel)
     - from: git_history
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "commits"
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Dynamic layout created linear chain**: Topological sort algorithm made nodes sequential. Fixed by preserving original positions from agents.yaml.
   - **Batch overlapping with Git/Vibe**: row=-0.5 too close to row=0. Fixed by increasing verticalGap and later normalizing all rows.
   - **Edges drawn to wrong positions**: Used `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` which had original positions instead of normalized. Fixed by using `visibleAgents.find()`.
   - **Curved arrow arrowheads disconnected**: Path end tangent not aligned with target. Fixed by adding straight final approach segments (vertical for normal, horizontal for loop-back).
   - **Unequal spacing around batch**: Negative rows not being normalized. Fixed by normalizing ALL rows to consecutive integers.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved: Centered column layout with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Solved: Arrow paths now have proper approach angles for arrowhead connection
   - Solved: Orchestrator centered above the column
   - In Progress: Equal spacing between all rows (just implemented normalization fix)

6. All user messages:
   - "now we have everything vertically aligned. Parallel steps (code, vibe) must be next to one another (same height). batch seems to be a node like 'coordinator'. Should this not be next to the main graph and get some feedback from some other step which triggers the next batch? Also, the arrows are now all over the place."
   - "almost - only batch remains a problem child (vibe in front of it --> batch-analysis & batch need shifted. Also KG-Ops is not connected to anything in the graph"

8. Current Work:
   The most recent work was fixing unequal vertical spacing between batch and its adjacent steps. The user said: "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"
   
   I fixed this by changing the row normalization to include ALL rows (including negative ones like -1 and -0.5), mapping them to consecutive integers:
   ```javascript
   // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
   uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
     rowMap.set(row, index)
   })
   ```
   
   This ensures rows like -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 9 become 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with equal spacing between all.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Verify the dashboard renders correctly with equal spacing between all rows. The user should refresh the dashboard at http://localhost:3032 to confirm the fix works. HMR should have already applied the changes..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: This was a continuation session focused on fixing DAG visualization issues in the UKB Workflow Monitor dashboard on port 3032.

2. **First User Feedback**: User reported layout still broken with overlapping nodes, Batch overlapping with other elements, and arrows not connecting properly.

3. **Layout Algorithm Changes**: 
   - Initially implemented a dynamic topological sort algorithm which created linear chains instead of parallel nodes
   - User complained about Git/Vibe not being side-by-side
   - Simplified to preserve original row/col positions from agents.yaml
   - Added row normalization to remove gaps

4. **Position Updates in agents.yaml**:
   - batch_scheduler: changed multiple times, finally to row=-0.5, col=0.6
   - git_history: col=0.25 (left of center)
   - vibe_history: col=0.95 (right of center)
   - All single agents (semantic, kg_operators, qa, checkpoint, persist, dedup, validate): col=0.6
   - orchestrator: col=0.6

5. **Edge Rendering Fix**:
   - Changed from `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` to `visibleAgents.find()` for proper normalized positions
   - This was causing edges to draw to wrong locations

6. **Arrow Fixes**:
   - Normal arrows: Added vertical final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
   - Loop-back arrows: Added horizontal final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY}`

7. **Vertical Spacing**:
   - Increased verticalGap from 15 to 40 to 60

8. **Most Recent Issue**: User pointed out spacing between batch and adjacent steps differs from other steps - caused by fractional row (-0.5) not being normalized

9. **Final Fix**: Changed normalization to include ALL rows (including negative), mapping them to consecutive integers starting from 0.

Key files modified:
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Fix the UKB Workflow Monitor DAG visualization layout for the batch-analysis workflow
   - Ensure all nodes form a centered column with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Fix arrow/arrowhead connections for curved paths (both normal and loop-back arrows)
   - Make vertical spacing uniform between ALL steps (no fractional row spacing differences)
   - Center the workflow header (batch-analysis/orchestrator) above the centered column

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - SVG-based DAG workflow visualization with React
   - Row/column grid positioning with normalization
   - Bezier curve path generation for edges with proper arrowhead alignment
   - HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for live dashboard updates
   - Single Source of Truth pattern (agents.yaml defines positions, API serves them)
   - Row normalization to consecutive integers for uniform spacing

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`**
     - Main workflow graph component - renders nodes and edges
     
     **Row normalization (most recent fix):**
     ```javascript
     // Normalize ALL row numbers to consecutive integers (e.g., rows -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4 → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
     // This ensures equal spacing between ALL rows regardless of original values
     const uniqueRows = [...new Set(filtered.map(a => a.row))].sort((a, b) => a - b)
     const rowMap = new Map<number, number>()

     // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
     uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
       rowMap.set(row, index)
     })
     ```
     
     **Vertical gap increased:**
     ```javascript
     const verticalGap = 60  // Increased for fractional row spacing
     ```
     
     **Edge rendering fix (use visibleAgents not WORKFLOW_AGENTS):**
     ```javascript
     // Handle orchestrator as source - use visibleAgents for normalized positions
     const fromAgent = edge.from === 'orchestrator'
       ? ORCHESTRATOR_NODE
       : visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.from)
     const toAgent = visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.to)
     ```
     
     **Normal arrow path with vertical approach:**
     ```javascript
     // Path with vertical final approach for proper arrowhead alignment
     const approachY = toY - 15  // Point above target for vertical approach
     const midY = (fromY + approachY) / 2
     path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY} C ${fromX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${approachY} L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
     ```
     
     **Loop-back arrow path with horizontal approach:**
     ```javascript
     if (isLoopBack) {
       // Loop-back path: curve to the left and up with horizontal final approach
       const leftOffset = 50  // How far left to curve
       const approachX = toX - 12  // Point for horizontal approach to target
       path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY}
               C ${fromX - leftOffset} ${fromY},
                 ${approachX - leftOffset} ${toY},
                 ${approachX} ${toY} L ${toX} ${toY}`
     }
     ```
     
     **Orchestrator position:**
     ```javascript
     const ORCHESTRATOR_NODE = {
       ...
       row: -1,  // Above all other nodes
       col: 0.6,  // Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     }
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`**
     - Single source of truth for agent definitions and positions
     
     **Key position updates:**
     ```yaml
     orchestrator:
       row: -1
       col: 0.6         # Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     
     batch_scheduler:
       row: -0.5       # Between orchestrator and main flow
       col: 0.6        # Centered in column
     
     git_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.25       # Left of center, adjacent to Vibe
     
     vibe_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.95       # Right of center, adjacent to Git
     
     # All single agents at col: 0.6
     semantic_analysis: row: 1, col: 0.6
     kg_operators: row: 4, col: 0.6
     quality_assurance: row: 6, col: 0.6
     batch_checkpoint_manager: row: 6.5, col: 0.6
     persistence: row: 7, col: 0.6
     deduplication: row: 8, col: 0.6
     content_validation: row: 9, col: 0.6
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`**
     - Updated edges to make git and vibe parallel:
     ```yaml
     # Batch extraction (parallel: both git and vibe receive batch info)
     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: git_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     # Data flow: vibe uses commits from git (but visually parallel)
     - from: git_history
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "commits"
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Dynamic layout created linear chain**: Topological sort algorithm made nodes sequential. Fixed by preserving original positions from agents.yaml.
   - **Batch overlapping with Git/Vibe**: row=-0.5 too close to row=0. Fixed by increasing verticalGap and later normalizing all rows.
   - **Edges drawn to wrong positions**: Used `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` which had original positions instead of normalized. Fixed by using `visibleAgents.find()`.
   - **Curved arrow arrowheads disconnected**: Path end tangent not aligned with target. Fixed by adding straight final approach segments (vertical for normal, horizontal for loop-back).
   - **Unequal spacing around batch**: Negative rows not being normalized. Fixed by normalizing ALL rows to consecutive integers.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved: Centered column layout with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Solved: Arrow paths now have proper approach angles for arrowhead connection
   - Solved: Orchestrator centered above the column
   - In Progress: Equal spacing between all rows (just implemented normalization fix)

6. All user messages:
   - "now we have everything vertically aligned. Parallel steps (code, vibe) must be next to one another (same height). batch seems to be a node like 'coordinator'. Should this not be next to the main graph and get some feedback from some other step which triggers the next batch? Also, the arrows are now all over the place."
   - "almost - only batch remains a problem child (vibe in front of it --> batch-analysis & batch need shifted. Also KG-Ops is not connected to anything in the graph"
   - "the arrows are hard to read as you failed to sufficiently space out the steps verticaly"
   - "why can you not have batch-analysis, batch, semantic, KG-Ops and everything that follows be center-aligned (so they form a column). This column should embed the parallel steps git and vibe (so that the right edge of git coincides with the left edge of vibe and this coincidental line is on the center line of the entiere column. Also, the arrows only (by chance) work for vertical arrow lines - all curved arrow lines fail to connect their arrow-head sided end to the broad part of the arrow triangle"
   - "almost - just batch analysis needs to be centered above batch and batch and git/vibe must not overlap (more vertical space needed around batch. Plus you failed to fix the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> arrow (same issue with the arrow-head connection)"
   - "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Verify the final row normalization fix resolves the unequal spacing issue

8. Current Work:
   The most recent work was fixing unequal vertical spacing between batch and its adjacent steps. The user said: "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"

   ```
   
   This ensures rows like -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 9 become 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with equal spacing between all.

### Grep - 2025-12-27 11:08:45 UTC [12:08:45 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. **Initial Context**: This was a continuation session focused on fixing DAG visualization issues in the UKB Workflow Monitor dashboard on port 3032.

2. **First User Feedback**: User reported layout still broken with overlapping nodes, Batch overlapping with other elements, and arrows not connecting properly.

3. **Layout Algorithm Changes**: 
   - Initially implemented a dynamic topological sort algorithm which created linear chains instead of parallel nodes
   - User complained about Git/Vibe not being side-by-side
   - Simplified to preserve original row/col positions from agents.yaml
   - Added row normalization to remove gaps

4. **Position Updates in agents.yaml**:
   - batch_scheduler: changed multiple times, finally to row=-0.5, col=0.6
   - git_history: col=0.25 (left of center)
   - vibe_history: col=0.95 (right of center)
   - All single agents (semantic, kg_operators, qa, checkpoint, persist, dedup, validate): col=0.6
   - orchestrator: col=0.6

5. **Edge Rendering Fix**:
   - Changed from `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` to `visibleAgents.find()` for proper normalized positions
   - This was causing edges to draw to wrong locations

6. **Arrow Fixes**:
   - Normal arrows: Added vertical final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
   - Loop-back arrows: Added horizontal final approach segment `L ${toX} ${toY}`

7. **Vertical Spacing**:
   - Increased verticalGap from 15 to 40 to 60

8. **Most Recent Issue**: User pointed out spacing between batch and adjacent steps differs from other steps - caused by fractional row (-0.5) not being normalized

9. **Final Fix**: Changed normalization to include ALL rows (including negative), mapping them to consecutive integers starting from 0.

Key files modified:
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`
- `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Fix the UKB Workflow Monitor DAG visualization layout for the batch-analysis workflow
   - Ensure all nodes form a centered column with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Fix arrow/arrowhead connections for curved paths (both normal and loop-back arrows)
   - Make vertical spacing uniform between ALL steps (no fractional row spacing differences)
   - Center the workflow header (batch-analysis/orchestrator) above the centered column

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - SVG-based DAG workflow visualization with React
   - Row/column grid positioning with normalization
   - Bezier curve path generation for edges with proper arrowhead alignment
   - HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for live dashboard updates
   - Single Source of Truth pattern (agents.yaml defines positions, API serves them)
   - Row normalization to consecutive integers for uniform spacing

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/system-health-dashboard/src/components/ukb-workflow-graph.tsx`**
     - Main workflow graph component - renders nodes and edges
     
     **Row normalization (most recent fix):**
     ```javascript
     // Normalize ALL row numbers to consecutive integers (e.g., rows -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4 → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
     // This ensures equal spacing between ALL rows regardless of original values
     const uniqueRows = [...new Set(filtered.map(a => a.row))].sort((a, b) => a - b)
     const rowMap = new Map<number, number>()

     // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
     uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
       rowMap.set(row, index)
     })
     ```
     
     **Vertical gap increased:**
     ```javascript
     const verticalGap = 60  // Increased for fractional row spacing
     ```
     
     **Edge rendering fix (use visibleAgents not WORKFLOW_AGENTS):**
     ```javascript
     // Handle orchestrator as source - use visibleAgents for normalized positions
     const fromAgent = edge.from === 'orchestrator'
       ? ORCHESTRATOR_NODE
       : visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.from)
     const toAgent = visibleAgents.find(a => a.id === edge.to)
     ```
     
     **Normal arrow path with vertical approach:**
     ```javascript
     // Path with vertical final approach for proper arrowhead alignment
     const approachY = toY - 15  // Point above target for vertical approach
     const midY = (fromY + approachY) / 2
     path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY} C ${fromX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${midY}, ${toX} ${approachY} L ${toX} ${toY - 3}`
     ```
     
     **Loop-back arrow path with horizontal approach:**
     ```javascript
     if (isLoopBack) {
       // Loop-back path: curve to the left and up with horizontal final approach
       const leftOffset = 50  // How far left to curve
       const approachX = toX - 12  // Point for horizontal approach to target
       path = `M ${fromX} ${fromY}
               C ${fromX - leftOffset} ${fromY},
                 ${approachX - leftOffset} ${toY},
                 ${approachX} ${toY} L ${toX} ${toY}`
     }
     ```
     
     **Orchestrator position:**
     ```javascript
     const ORCHESTRATOR_NODE = {
       ...
       row: -1,  // Above all other nodes
       col: 0.6,  // Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     }
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/agents.yaml`**
     - Single source of truth for agent definitions and positions
     
     **Key position updates:**
     ```yaml
     orchestrator:
       row: -1
       col: 0.6         # Centered (aligned with single-agent column)
     
     batch_scheduler:
       row: -0.5       # Between orchestrator and main flow
       col: 0.6        # Centered in column
     
     git_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.25       # Left of center, adjacent to Vibe
     
     vibe_history:
       row: 0
       col: 0.95       # Right of center, adjacent to Git
     
     # All single agents at col: 0.6
     semantic_analysis: row: 1, col: 0.6
     kg_operators: row: 4, col: 0.6
     quality_assurance: row: 6, col: 0.6
     batch_checkpoint_manager: row: 6.5, col: 0.6
     persistence: row: 7, col: 0.6
     deduplication: row: 8, col: 0.6
     content_validation: row: 9, col: 0.6
     ```

   - **`<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/config/workflows/batch-analysis.yaml`**
     - Updated edges to make git and vibe parallel:
     ```yaml
     # Batch extraction (parallel: both git and vibe receive batch info)
     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: git_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     - from: batch_scheduler
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "per batch"

     # Data flow: vibe uses commits from git (but visually parallel)
     - from: git_history
       to: vibe_history
       type: dataflow
       label: "commits"
     ```

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Dynamic layout created linear chain**: Topological sort algorithm made nodes sequential. Fixed by preserving original positions from agents.yaml.
   - **Batch overlapping with Git/Vibe**: row=-0.5 too close to row=0. Fixed by increasing verticalGap and later normalizing all rows.
   - **Edges drawn to wrong positions**: Used `WORKFLOW_AGENTS.find()` which had original positions instead of normalized. Fixed by using `visibleAgents.find()`.
   - **Curved arrow arrowheads disconnected**: Path end tangent not aligned with target. Fixed by adding straight final approach segments (vertical for normal, horizontal for loop-back).
   - **Unequal spacing around batch**: Negative rows not being normalized. Fixed by normalizing ALL rows to consecutive integers.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved: Centered column layout with Git/Vibe side-by-side
   - Solved: Arrow paths now have proper approach angles for arrowhead connection
   - Solved: Orchestrator centered above the column
   - In Progress: Equal spacing between all rows (just implemented normalization fix)

6. All user messages:
   - "now we have everything vertically aligned. Parallel steps (code, vibe) must be next to one another (same height). batch seems to be a node like 'coordinator'. Should this not be next to the main graph and get some feedback from some other step which triggers the next batch? Also, the arrows are now all over the place."
   - "almost - only batch remains a problem child (vibe in front of it --> batch-analysis & batch need shifted. Also KG-Ops is not connected to anything in the graph"
   - "the arrows are hard to read as you failed to sufficiently space out the steps verticaly"
   - "why can you not have batch-analysis, batch, semantic, KG-Ops and everything that follows be center-aligned (so they form a column). This column should embed the parallel steps git and vibe (so that the right edge of git coincides with the left edge of vibe and this coincidental line is on the center line of the entiere column. Also, the arrows only (by chance) work for vertical arrow lines - all curved arrow lines fail to connect their arrow-head sided end to the broad part of the arrow triangle"
   - "almost - just batch analysis needs to be centered above batch and batch and git/vibe must not overlap (more vertical space needed around batch. Plus you failed to fix the <COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED> arrow (same issue with the arrow-head connection)"
   - "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Verify the final row normalization fix resolves the unequal spacing issue

8. Current Work:
   The most recent work was fixing unequal vertical spacing between batch and its adjacent steps. The user said: "why is the spacing between batch and its adjacent steps (before/after) different from all other steps - make this the same!"
   
   I fixed this by changing the row normalization to include ALL rows (including negative ones like -1 and -0.5), mapping them to consecutive integers:
   ```javascript
   // Map all rows to consecutive integers starting from 0
   uniqueRows.forEach((row, index) => {
     rowMap.set(row, index)
   })
   ```
   
   This ensures rows like -1, -0.5, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 9 become 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 with equal spacing between all.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Verify the dashboard renders correctly with equal spacing between all rows. The user should refresh the dashboard at http://localhost:3032 to confirm the fix works. HMR should have already applied the changes..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v \"_from-\" | head -3",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-12-27_1200-1300_g9b30a.md"
}
```

**Result:** ❌ Error
**Output:** ```
File content (48527 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific portions of the file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.

### Bash - 2025-12-27 11:23:38 UTC [12:23:38 CEST]

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v \"_from-\" | head -3",
  "description": "Find latest local coding session logs"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)

- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json

### Bash - 2025-12-27 11:23:38 UTC [12:23:38 CEST]

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-12-27_1200-1300_g9b30a.md",

### Bash - 2025-12-27 11:23:38 UTC [12:23:38 CEST]

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",
  "description": "Confirm current project directory"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)

### Bash - 2025-12-27 11:23:38 UTC [12:23:38 CEST]

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",
  "description": "Confirm current project directory"

**Result:** ✅ Success

4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -10",
  "description": "Find redirected logs from all projects"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-12-25_1700-1800_g9b30a_from-ui-template.md",
  "limit": 150
}

**Result:** ✅ Success

### Bash - 2025-12-27 11:23:38 UTC [12:23:38 CEST]

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "pwd",
  "description": "Confirm current project directory"

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-12-27_1200-1300_g9b30a.md"
}
```

**Result:** ❌ Error
**Output:** ```
File content (48527 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific portions of the file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.

5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2025-12-25_1700-1800_g9b30a_from-ui-template.md",

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
