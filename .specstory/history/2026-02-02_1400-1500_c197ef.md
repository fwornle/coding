WIP: Online learning and trajectory detection have been implemented, they are just not fully working yet and need more work. So... more than "coming soon" - definitely already there. Branding: ok as is

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs-content/getting-started/installation.md",
  "content": "# Installation\n\nStep-by-step guide to install coding on your system.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore installing, ensure you have these tools:\n\n=== \"macOS\"\n\n    ```bash\n    # Install prerequisites\n    brew install git node jq\n\n    # Install Docker Desktop (for recommended Docker mode)\n    brew install --cask docker\n    ```\n\n=== \"Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)\"\n\n    ```bash\n    # Install prerequisites\n    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git nodejs npm jq\n\n    # Install Docker\n    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh\n    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  # Log out and back in\n    ```\n\n=== \"Windows (WSL2)\"\n\n    1. Install [WSL2](https://docs.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)\n    2. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\n    3. In WSL2:\n       ```bash\n       sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git nodejs npm jq\n       ```\n\n### Version Requirements\n\n| Tool | Minimum Version | Check Command |\n|------|----------------|---------------|\n| Node.js | 18+ | `node --version` |\n| Git | 2.0+ | `git --version` |\n| Docker | 20+ | `docker --version` |\n| jq | 1.6+ | `jq --version` |\n\n---\n\n## Docker Installation (Recommended)\n\nDocker mode provides the best experience with isolated services, persistent state, and easy management.\n\n![Docker Architecture](../images/docker-architecture.png)\n\n### Step 1: Clone Repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fwornle/coding ~/Agentic/coding\ncd ~/Agentic/coding\n```\n\n!!! tip \"Existing Clone?\"\n    If you already cloned without submodules:\n    ```bash\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n    ```\n\n### Step 2: Run Installer\n\n```bash\n./install.sh\n```\n\nThe installer will:\n\n1. Detect Docker availability\n2. Create `.docker-mode` marker (enables Docker mode)\n3. Build Docker containers\n4. Configure Claude MCP servers for SSE/HTTP communication\n5. Set up Claude hooks (LSL, constraints)\n6. Initialize knowledge store\n7. Add `coding` and `vkb` commands to your PATH\n\n!!! info \"Non-Intrusive Installation\"\n    The installer prompts before any system changes and creates timestamped backups of your shell configuration. Use `--skip-all` to decline all system-level changes.\n\n### Step 3: Reload Shell\n\n```bash\nsource ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for Zsh\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify Installation\n\n```bash\ncoding --health\n```\n\n![Health Check](../images/install-health-check.png)\n\nYou should see all services reporting healthy (green).\n\n### Step 5: Start Coding\n\n```bash\ncoding\n```\n\n![Coding Startup](../images/coding-startup-dockerized.png)\n\n---\n\n## Native Installation\n\nNative mode runs MCP servers as direct Node.js processes. Use this if you prefer not to use Docker or need lower resource usage.\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n```bash\n# Clone repository\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fwornle/coding ~/Agentic/coding\ncd ~/Agentic/coding\n\n# Remove Docker mode marker (ensures native mode)\nrm -f .docker-mode\n\n# Run installer\n./install.sh\n\n# Reload shell\nsource ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n### Native vs Docker Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Docker Mode | Native Mode |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Isolation** | Full container isolation | Runs in your environment |\n| **Persistence** | Services survive restarts | Restarted each session |\n| **Resources** | Higher (Docker overhead) | Lower |\n| **Setup** | Requires Docker | Node.js only |\n| **Browser sharing** | Multiple sessions share browser | Per-session browser |\n| **Debugging** | Container logs | Direct process logs |\n\n---\n\n## Switching Modes\n\nYou can switch between Docker and Native modes at any time.\n\n### Docker to Native\n\n```bash\ncoding --switch-to-native\n```\n\nOr manually:\n\n```bash\nrm -f .docker-mode\ndocker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down\n```\n\n### Native to Docker\n\n```bash\ncoding --switch-to-docker\n```\n\nOr manually:\n\n```bash\ntouch .docker-mode\n./install.sh  # Rebuilds Docker config\n```\n\n![Mode Transition](../images/docker-mode-state-machine.png)\n\nFor detailed transition documentation, see [Docker Mode Setup Guide](../guides/docker-mode-setup.md).\n\n---\n\n## What Gets Installed\n\n| Component | Location | Purpose |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| `coding` command | `~/Agentic/coding/bin/` | Launch Claude with all integrations |\n| `vkb` command | `~/Agentic/coding/bin/` | View Knowledge Base |\n| `ukb` command | `~/Agentic/coding/bin/` | Update Knowledge Base |\n| MCP Servers | Docker or native | Semantic Analysis, Constraints, etc. |\n| Claude Hooks | `~/.claude/settings.json` | LSL monitoring, constraint checks |\n| Knowledge Store | `.data/knowledge-graph/` | Graph database |\n| Session Logs | `.specstory/history/` | LSL files |\n\n### Configuration Files Created\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Claude hooks configuration |\n| `.env` | API keys and settings |\n| `.env.ports` | Port configuration |\n| `.docker-mode` | Docker mode marker (if Docker) |\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting Installation\n\n### Docker Not Found\n\n```bash\n# Verify Docker is installed\ndocker --version\n\n# Verify Docker daemon is running\ndocker info\n\n# On macOS, ensure Docker Desktop is running\n```\n\n### Permission Denied\n\n```bash\n# Fix Docker socket permissions (Linux)\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n# Log out and back in\n\n# Fix directory permissions\nchmod -R 755 ~/Agentic/coding\n```\n\n### Submodules Missing\n\n```bash\ncd ~/Agentic/coding\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n### Port Conflicts\n\n```bash\n# Check what's using a port\nlsof -i :8080\n\n# Change ports in .env.ports\ncat .env.ports\n```\n\n### Reinstallation\n\nTo completely reinstall:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/Agentic/coding\n\n# Stop all services\ndocker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down 2>/dev/null\npkill -f \"coding\"\n\n# Clean state (preserves knowledge base)\nrm -f .docker-mode .transition-in-progress\n\n# Reinstall\n./install.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Verify Installation](verify-repair.md) - Detailed verification and repair\n- [Configuration](configuration.md) - API keys and provider setup\n- [First Usage](index.md#first-usage) - Start using coding\n\n---\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- [Docker Mode Details](docker-mode.md) - In-depth Docker configuration\n- [Docker Mode Setup Guide](../guides/docker-mode-setup.md) - Advanced transition scenarios\n- [Troubleshooting](../reference/troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions\n"

The configuration depends on your deployment mode.\n\n### Docker Mode (Default)\n\nMCP servers run as HTTP/SSE services in Docker containers. Claude communicates via stdio-proxy:\n\n```\nClaude Code <-> stdio-proxy.js <-> HTTP/SSE <-> Docker Container\n```\n\n### Native Mode\n\nMCP servers run as direct Node.js processes managed by Claude CLI:\n\n```\nClaude Code <-> stdio <-> Node.js Process\n```\n\n### Configuration Location\n\n- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.claude/settings.json`\n- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/settings.json`\n\n!!! note \"Auto-Configuration\"\n    The installer creates and maintains MCP configuration. Manual editing is rarely needed.\n\n---\n\n## Available Tools\n\nEach MCP server provides tools accessible within Claude sessions:\n\n### Semantic Analysis Tools\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `determine_insights` | AI-powered content analysis |\n| `execute_workflow` | Run multi-agent workflows |\n| `analyze_code` | Code pattern analysis |\n| `analyze_repository` | Repository-wide analysis |\n| `create_ukb_entity_with_insight` | Create knowledge entities |\n| `refresh_entity` | Update stale entities |\n\n### Constraint Monitor Tools\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `check_constraints` | Validate code against constraints |\n| `get_violation_history` | View past violations |\n| `get_constraint_status` | Current compliance metrics |\n| `update_constraints` | Modify constraint rules |\n\n### Browser Access Tools\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `stagehand_navigate` | Navigate to URL |\n| `stagehand_act` | Perform page actions |\n| `stagehand_extract` | Extract page content |\n| `stagehand_observe` | Find interactive elements |\n| `screenshot` | Capture page screenshot |\n\n### Code Graph RAG Tools\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `query_code_graph` | Natural language <USER_ID_REDACTED> |\n| `index_repository` | Build code graph |\n| `get_code_snippet` | Retrieve source code |\n| `comprehensive_analysis` | Deep code analysis |\n\n---\n\n## Health Checks\n\n### Docker Mode\n\n```bash\n# Check all health endpoints\nfor port in 3847 3848 3849 3850 8080 3032; do\n  echo \"Port $port: $(curl -s http://localhost:$port/health | jq -r '.status // \"N/A\"')\"\ndone\n```\n\n### Native Mode\n\n```bash\n# Check if MCP servers are registered\ncat ~/.claude/settings.json | jq '.mcpServers | keys'\n```\n\n---\n\n## Submodule Management\n\nIntegration components are git submodules:\n\n```bash\n# Update all submodules\ngit submodule update --remote\n\n# Initialize missing submodules\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\n# Update specific submodule\ngit submodule update --remote integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis\n```\n\n---\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- [Configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md) - API keys and settings\n- [Docker Mode](../getting-started/docker-mode.md) - Container deployment\n- [Data Flow](../architecture/data-flow.md) - Integration data flow\n"

WIP: Online learning and trajectory detection have been implemented, they are just not fully working yet and need more work. So... more than "coming soon" - definitely already there. Branding: ok as is

**Tool:** Write
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs-content/getting-started/installation.md",
  "content": "# Installation\n\nStep-by-step guide to install coding on your system.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore installing, ensure you have these tools:\n\n=== \"macOS\"\n\n    ```bash\n    # Install prerequisites\n    brew install git node jq\n\n    # Install Docker Desktop (for recommended Docker mode)\n    brew install --cask docker\n    ```\n\n=== \"Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)\"\n\n    ```bash\n    # Install prerequisites\n    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git nodejs npm jq\n\n    # Install Docker\n    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh\n    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  # Log out and back in\n    ```\n\n=== \"Windows (WSL2)\"\n\n    1. Install [WSL2](https://docs.<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)\n    2. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\n    3. In WSL2:\n       ```bash\n       sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git nodejs npm jq\n       ```\n\n### Version Requirements\n\n| Tool | Minimum Version | Check Command |\n|------|----------------|---------------|\n| Node.js | 18+ | `node --version` |\n| Git | 2.0+ | `git --version` |\n| Docker | 20+ | `docker --version` |\n| jq | 1.6+ | `jq --version` |\n\n---\n\n## Docker Installation (Recommended)\n\nDocker mode provides the best experience with isolated services, persistent state, and easy management.\n\n![Docker Architecture](../images/docker-architecture.png)\n\n### Step 1: Clone Repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fwornle/coding ~/Agentic/coding\ncd ~/Agentic/coding\n```\n\n!!! tip \"Existing Clone?\"\n    If you already cloned without submodules:\n    ```bash\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n    ```\n\n### Step 2: Run Installer\n\n```bash\n./install.sh\n```\n\nThe installer will:\n\n1. Detect Docker availability\n2. Create `.docker-mode` marker (enables Docker mode)\n3. Build Docker containers\n4. Configure Claude MCP servers for SSE/HTTP communication\n5. Set up Claude hooks (LSL, constraints)\n6. Initialize knowledge store\n7. Add `coding` and `vkb` commands to your PATH\n\n!!! info \"Non-Intrusive Installation\"\n    The installer prompts before any system changes and creates timestamped backups of your shell configuration. Use `--skip-all` to decline all system-level changes.\n\n### Step 3: Reload Shell\n\n```bash\nsource ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for Zsh\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify Installation\n\n```bash\ncoding --health\n```\n\n![Health Check](../images/install-health-check.png)\n\nYou should see all services reporting healthy (green).\n\n### Step 5: Start Coding\n\n```bash\ncoding\n```\n\n![Coding Startup](../images/coding-startup-dockerized.png)\n\n---\n\n## Native Installation\n\nNative mode runs MCP servers as direct Node.js processes. Use this if you prefer not to use Docker or need lower resource usage.\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n```bash\n# Clone repository\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fwornle/coding ~/Agentic/coding\ncd ~/Agentic/coding\n\n# Remove Docker mode marker (ensures native mode)\nrm -f .docker-mode\n\n# Run installer\n./install.sh\n\n# Reload shell\nsource ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n### Native vs Docker Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Docker Mode | Native Mode |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Isolation** | Full container isolation | Runs in your environment |\n| **Persistence** | Services survive restarts | Restarted each session |\n| **Resources** | Higher (Docker overhead) | Lower |\n| **Setup** | Requires Docker | Node.js only |\n| **Browser sharing** | Multiple sessions share browser | Per-session browser |\n| **Debugging** | Container logs | Direct process logs |\n\n---\n\n## Switching Modes\n\nYou can switch between Docker and Native modes at any time.\n\n### Docker to Native\n\n```bash\ncoding --switch-to-native\n```\n\nOr manually:\n\n```bash\nrm -f .docker-mode\ndocker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down\n```\n\n### Native to Docker\n\n```bash\ncoding --switch-to-docker\n```\n\nOr manually:\n\n```bash\ntouch .docker-mode\n./install.sh  # Rebuilds Docker config\n```\n\n![Mode Transition](../images/docker-mode-state-machine.png)\n\nFor detailed transition documentation, see [Docker Mode Setup Guide](../guides/docker-mode-setup.md).\n\n---\n\n## What Gets Installed\n\n| Component | Location | Purpose |\n|-----------|----------|---------|\n| `coding` command | `~/Agentic/coding/bin/` | Launch Claude with all integrations |\n| `vkb` command | `~/Agentic/coding/bin/` | View Knowledge Base |\n| `ukb` command | `~/Agentic/coding/bin/` | Update Knowledge Base |\n| MCP Servers | Docker or native | Semantic Analysis, Constraints, etc. |\n| Claude Hooks | `~/.claude/settings.json` | LSL monitoring, constraint checks |\n| Knowledge Store | `.data/knowledge-graph/` | Graph database |\n| Session Logs | `.specstory/history/` | LSL files |\n\n### Configuration Files Created\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Claude hooks configuration |\n| `.env` | API keys and settings |\n| `.env.ports` | Port configuration |\n| `.docker-mode` | Docker mode marker (if Docker) |\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting Installation\n\n### Docker Not Found\n\n```bash\n# Verify Docker is installed\ndocker --version\n\n# Verify Docker daemon is running\ndocker info\n\n# On macOS, ensure Docker Desktop is running\n```\n\n### Permission Denied\n\n```bash\n# Fix Docker socket permissions (Linux)\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n# Log out and back in\n\n# Fix directory permissions\nchmod -R 755 ~/Agentic/coding\n```\n\n### Submodules Missing\n\n```bash\ncd ~/Agentic/coding\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n### Port Conflicts\n\n```bash\n# Check what's using a port\nlsof -i :8080\n\n# Change ports in .env.ports\ncat .env.ports\n```\n\n### Reinstallation\n\nTo completely reinstall:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/Agentic/coding\n\n# Stop all services\ndocker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down 2>/dev/null\npkill -f \"coding\"\n\n# Clean state (preserves knowledge base)\nrm -f .docker-mode .transition-in-progress\n\n# Reinstall\n./install.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Verify Installation](verify-repair.md) - Detailed verification and repair\n- [Configuration](configuration.md) - API keys and provider setup\n- [First Usage](index.md#first-usage) - Start using coding\n\n---\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- [Docker Mode Details](docker-mode.md) - In-depth Docker configuration\n- [Docker Mode Setup Guide](../guides/docker-mode-setup.md) - Advanced transition scenarios\n- [Troubleshooting](../reference/troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions\n"

If you see red indicators, follow the troubleshooting steps below.\n\n---\n\n## Automated Test Suite\n\nThe test script verifies all components:\n\n```bash\n# Check-only mode (default)\n./scripts/test-coding.sh\n\n# Interactive repair mode\n./scripts/test-coding.sh --interactive\n\n# Verbose output\n./scripts/test-coding.sh --verbose\n```\n\n### Test Categories\n\n| Test | What It Checks |\n|------|----------------|\n| Prerequisites | Node.js, Git, jq, Docker versions |\n| Commands | `coding`, `vkb`, `ukb` in PATH |\n| Configuration | `.env`, hooks, MCP config |\n| Services | Docker containers or native processes |\n| Connectivity | Health endpoints, port availability |\n| Knowledge Base | Graph database accessibility |\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Verification\n\n### 1. Check Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n# Node.js 18+\nnode --version\n\n# Git\ngit --version\n\n# jq\njq --version\n\n# Docker (if Docker mode)\ndocker --version\ndocker info\n```\n\n### 2. Verify Commands Available\n\n```bash\n# Should show help\ncoding --help\nvkb --help\n\n# Check locations\nwhich coding\nwhich vkb\n```\n\nIf commands not found, check your PATH:\n\n```bash\necho $PATH | grep -q \"Agentic/coding/bin\" && echo \"OK\" || echo \"Missing from PATH\"\n```\n\n### 3. Check Docker Services (Docker Mode)\n\n```bash\n# List running containers\ndocker compose -f ~/Agentic/coding/docker/docker-compose.yml ps\n\n# Expected output shows these services running:\n# - coding-services (main MCP servers)\n# - memgraph (graph database)\n# - qdrant (vector database)\n```\n\n### 4.
