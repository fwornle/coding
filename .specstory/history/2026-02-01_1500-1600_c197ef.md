  "pattern": "purge-knowledge|purge.*entities",
  "path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding",
  "glob": "*.md"
}

**Tool:** Task
**Input:** ```json
{
  "prompt": "Find and analyze how insight document links are handled in the VKB viewer / system-health-dashboard. I need to understand:\n\n1. Where insight document links are displayed (look for the modal that shows \"2026-01-25_1100-1200_c197ef.md\")\n2. How the frontend fetches the insight content when the link is clicked\n3. What API endpoint or route serves the insight markdown files\n4. Why it might be returning HTML (React app index.html) instead of markdown content\n\nLook in:\n- integrations/system-health-dashboard/src/ for components showing insight links\n- lib/vkb-server/ for API routes serving insights\n- Any insight-related fetch calls or API endpoints\n\nThis is to fix a bug where clicking an insight link shows HTML instead of markdown content.",

**User Request:** the vkb viewer seems to show a ton of unconnected nodes. Presumably, the ones added over the past 2 days. Revert to an unbroken state (or remove those nodes that got added over the past 3 days - there is a script in scripts that does this... and CLAUDE.md might even mention it)

**Input:** ```json

**Tool:** Task
**Input:** ```json
{
  "prompt": "Find and analyze how insight document links are handled in the VKB viewer / system-health-dashboard. I need to understand:\n\n1. Where insight document links are displayed (look for the modal that shows \"2026-01-25_1100-1200_c197ef.md\")\n2. How the frontend fetches the insight content when the link is clicked\n3. What API endpoint or route serves the insight markdown files\n4. Why it might be returning HTML (React app index.html) instead of markdown content\n\nLook in:\n- integrations/system-health-dashboard/src/ for components showing insight links\n- lib/vkb-server/ for API routes serving insights\n- Any insight-related fetch calls or API endpoints\n\nThis is to fix a bug where clicking an insight link shows HTML instead of markdown content.",

**Tool:** Task
**Input:** ```json

What API endpoint or route serves the insight markdown files\n4. Why it might be returning HTML (React app index.html) instead of markdown content\n\nLook in:\n- integrations/system-health-dashboard/src/ for components showing insight links\n- lib/vkb-server/ for API routes serving insights\n- Any insight-related fetch calls or API endpoints\n\nThis is to fix a bug where clicking an insight link shows HTML instead of markdown content.",
