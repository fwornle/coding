# Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps
1. Determine current project/repo name from git remote or directory name
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history files
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files
4. Compare timestamps to determine work context:
   - If coding files are newer/same: present coding summary
   - If only coding files exist: present coding summary
   - If mixed timeframes: present combined summary
5. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Implementation Notes
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Coding sessions in /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Timestamp comparison determines primary work context
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Expected Behavior

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project/repo name** from git remote or directory name
2. **Find session logs** from both local (.specstory/history/) and coding project histories
3. **Compare timestamps** to determine primary work context
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent session logs for continuity
5. **Present context-aware summaries** based on detected work patterns

### Assistant

I'll read the recent session logs to provide continuity.

Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.

## Recent Session Summary (0700-0800 today)

**Parallel sessions detected** - both local coding and cross-project work from curriculum-alignment:

### Local Coding Session
- User questioning why "coding" status is "amber"
- Session continuation from previous context loss
- Status goes to black quickly (5-10 minutes)
- Multiple `/sl` command executions

### Cross-Project Work (from curriculum-alignment)
**Primary issues identified:**

1. **LSL Misclassification Problem**
   - Many coding infrastructure sessions in curriculum-alignment incorrectly classified as "local"
   - Should have been redirected to coding with `_from-curriculum-alignment.md` suffix
   - Invalid `_from-curriculum-alignment.md` files found IN curriculum-alignment (impossible - those only belong in coding)

2. **Startup Issue in coding/bin/coding**
   - **Bug**: `RealTimeTrajectoryAnalyzer.getCurrentTrajectoryState()` (line 549) returning `lastUpdate: this.lastAnalysisTime` which is null initially
   - **Root cause**: Analyzer's internal `lastAnalysisTime` doesn't sync with `.specstory/trajectory/live-state.json` file's `lastUpdate` timestamp
   - **Status**: Fix was implemented but startup still showing issues

**Current state**: Ongoing debugging of service startup issues with amber status indicators.
