### Text Exchange - 2025-12-08 05:37:58 UTC [06:37:58 CEST]

**User Message:** analyze how the ontology is working in the semantic analysis mcp server (if at all). I would like to be able to "inject" an ontology (upper for the area/cluster and team specific) and have the server use this when acquiring or updating knowledge. In addition, the ontology shall be transparent, i. e. I want to be able to view (and edit) the ontology in the viewer (vkb). ultrathink. use serena to analyze all relevant code. make a plan of what would have to change for this to become possilbe.

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
