**User Request:** the devContainer now installs AWS-CLI. Running scripts/setup.sh (inside the CN) appears to do something, but it might just get stuck too (had to CTRL+C it after a long time... probably stalled). Add a log of everything that goes on so we can debug and trace any issues with the set-up / deployment.

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json

  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/scripts/setup.sh"

**User Request:** before you do that - why is the status line showing a "stale project"?   [GCM✅] [C🟢 MM⚫ ND⚫ UT🟡(stale) VV⚫] [🛡️ 100% 🔍EX] [Gq● A$18 O○ X$25] [📚❌] [🏥⏰] 📋7-8 ... and why is the health "degraded" - plus, I don't see any LSL in project ui-template... so, maybe the fix to the LSL monitor we just made in "coding" did not automatically get applied to all open sessions, despite you just telling me that it would:\

> what will happen, if I continue to work in a parallel coding session now? Will we have to restart the transcript monitor 
associated with that session to apply the recent fixes, or will I have to re-start that session first? Or, does the fix you made 
apply to all running sessions without further steps? 

⏺ The fix applies immediately to all sessions without any restart needed. Here's why:

  How it Works

  The transcript monitor runs as a single shared process that watches the Claude transcript directory
  (~/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-coding/). It:

  1. Monitors all transcript files in that directory - regardless of which Claude session created them
  2. Reads the JavaScript file directly at startup - since I edited scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js, the fix is in the
  source
  3. The running monitor (PID 11610) was restarted after the fix was applied

  Your Parallel Session Scenario

  When you work in another coding session:
  - That session writes to a transcript file (.jsonl)
  - The already-running fixed monitor detects changes and processes them
  - LSL files are generated correctly with the fix in place

  No restart needed - the monitor is already running with the fix applied.

  One Caveat

  If the global LSL coordinator spawns a new monitor instance for some reason (e.g., the current one crashes or you start a
  completely different project), it would automatically use the fixed code since the fix is in the source file.

  Bottom line: You can start working in parallel sessions immediately. The fix is active. ✅

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "cd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding && cat .logs/statusline-health-status.txt 2>/dev/null",
  "description": "Check current health status"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

**User Request:** before you do that - why is the status line showing a "stale project"?   [GCM✅] [C🟢 MM⚫ ND⚫ UT🟡(stale) VV⚫] [🛡️ 100% 🔍EX] [Gq● A$18 O○ X$25] [📚❌] [🏥⏰] 📋7-8 ... and why is the health "degraded" - plus, I don't see any LSL in project ui-template... so, maybe the fix to the LSL monitor we just made in "coding" did not automatically get applied to all open sessions, despite you just telling me that it would:\

> what will happen, if I continue to work in a parallel coding session now? Will we have to restart the transcript monitor 
associated with that session to apply the recent fixes, or will I have to re-start that session first? Or, does the fix you made 
apply to all running sessions without further steps? 

⏺ The fix applies immediately to all sessions without any restart needed. Here's why:

  How it Works

  The transcript monitor runs as a single shared process that watches the Claude transcript directory
  (~/.claude/projects/-Users-<USER_ID_REDACTED>-Agentic-coding/). It:

  1. Monitors all transcript files in that directory - regardless of which Claude session created them
  2. Reads the JavaScript file directly at startup - since I edited scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js, the fix is in the
  source
  3. The running monitor (PID 11610) was restarted after the fix was applied

  Your Parallel Session Scenario

  When you work in another coding session:
  - That session writes to a transcript file (.jsonl)
  - The already-running fixed monitor detects changes and processes them
  - LSL files are generated correctly with the fix in place

  No restart needed - the monitor is already running with the fix applied.

  One Caveat

  If the global LSL coordinator spawns a new monitor instance for some reason (e.g., the current one crashes or you start a
  completely different project), it would automatically use the fixed code since the fix is in the source file.

  Bottom line: You can start working in parallel sessions immediately. The fix is active. ✅

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "# Kill any zombie processes first, then start fresh\npkill -f \"enhanced-transcript-monitor.js.*ui-template\" 2>/dev/null || true\nsleep 1\n\n# Start the transcript monitor for ui-template properly\ncd /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template\nnohup node /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template > /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/.logs/transcript-monitor.log 2>&1 &\nMONITOR_PID=$!\necho \"Started transcript monitor with PID: $MONITOR_PID\"\nsleep 3\n\n# Verify it's actually running\nif kill -0 $MONITOR_PID 2>/dev/null; then\n    echo \"Monitor is running successfully\"\n    ps aux | grep $MONITOR_PID | grep -v grep\nelse\n    echo \"Monitor failed to start! Check logs:\"\n    cat /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/ui-template/.logs/transcript-monitor.log 2>/dev/null | tail -30\nfi",
  "description": "Restart ui-template transcript monitor"
}
```

**Result:** ❌ Error
