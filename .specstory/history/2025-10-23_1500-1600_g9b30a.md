**User Message:** this diagram suggests that the JSON export is optional... but that's no longer true! (we need this to enable cross-project and cross-team persistence... i. e. the JSON generation needs to happen continuously whenever the DB contents change - read the storage concept documentation and corresponding codebase (serena) and check,if this diagram is already correct. '/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/images/graph-storage-architecture.png' Also, why do you mention the removed legacy system?...

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)
