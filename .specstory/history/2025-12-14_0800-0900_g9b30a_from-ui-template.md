**User Message:** all the changes in the ui-template change set should not be there - I asked you to do a full ukb on project DynArch... so all of these files should have appeared in coding!! our knowledgebase files are kept in coding. Fix this and analyze how this happened (from the logs and using serena from the codebase of the semantic analysis mcp server)
