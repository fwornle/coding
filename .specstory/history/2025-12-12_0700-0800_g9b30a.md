**User Message:** have you already updated the puml/png's which depict the (now) 13-agent system, both in regular mode as well as in presentation mode?\
Also, you seem to "hang" for a long time when I ask you to do this knowledge-base update (full) - it's hard for the user to figure out if the analysis is still running or not. Can you provide more status information of what's happening while the MCP server (semantic analysis) is running?\

**User Message:** As a full analysis can take considerable time, we should run individual node updates in parallel processes (ukb full) - you might already do this. However, this also means that we need to register and monitor those processes and allow the user to see what's going on. Add a new statusLine counter that shows how many ukb processes are currently running. Add a health monitoring that allows to detect stale, frozen and orphaned processes. Add a clean-up mechanism that removes frozen and stale process...

Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Request - Session Log Reading (`/sl` command)**
   - User ran `/sl` to read session logs for continuity
   - I identified we're in the coding project
   - Found recent sessions about 13-agent system, code-graph-rag integration, full UKB workflow

2. **`full ukb` Request**
   - User requested full know...

**User Message:** this seems odd: should the elapsing "next update" counter not lead to a reset of the "last verified" counter? [Image #1]

**User Message:** [Image #1] - this is still counter-intuitive. Why do we "refresh" more often then "verify"? what's the difference?
