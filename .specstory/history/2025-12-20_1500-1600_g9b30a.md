### Bash - 2025-12-20 14:43:50 UTC [15:43:50 CEST]

**User Request:** the status line in the (unused but open) "virgin" session "CA" is this:  [GCM✅] [C🟢 UT🟢 ND🟢 CA🟢] - this reflects the state at the time of the last update of this status line (whe we started the session). From session "coding" we have: [GCM✅] [C🟢 UT🪨 ND🟢 CA🪨]  - this indicates that coding (recently active) sees UT and CA as almost entirely cooled down states.\
It seems that the status line of a coding session is only ever updated when there is activity in the session. Investigate if there is a way to periodically update the status line of every open session (eg. triggered by a slow process, eg. every 15 seconds). This should only happen when at least one session is truly "green", i. e. when the user is in front of the computer. Whenever they are not using at least one session, the background update should be reduced to everytime one of the sessions would change status (eg. cool down one more step).\
We would like a system where we can more or less always look at an up-to-date status across all projects (even if they are only sitting there idle or asleep).

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "grep -n \"statusline\\|status-line\\|status_line\" /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/.claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null | head -20",
  "description": "Check Claude settings for status line config"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

**User Request:** the status line in the (unused but open) "virgin" session "CA" is this:  [GCM✅] [C🟢 UT🟢 ND🟢 CA🟢] - this reflects the state at the time of the last update of this status line (whe we started the session). From session "coding" we have: [GCM✅] [C🟢 UT🪨 ND🟢 CA🪨]  - this indicates that coding (recently active) sees UT and CA as almost entirely cooled down states.\
It seems that the status line of a coding session is only ever updated when there is activity in the session. Investigate if there is a way to periodically update the status line of every open session (eg. triggered by a slow process, eg. every 15 seconds). This should only happen when at least one session is truly "green", i. e. when the user is in front of the computer. Whenever they are not using at least one session, the background update should be reduced to everytime one of the sessions would change status (eg. cool down one more step).\
We would like a system where we can more or less always look at an up-to-date status across all projects (even if they are only sitting there idle or asleep).

Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.
