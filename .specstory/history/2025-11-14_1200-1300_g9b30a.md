### User

Warmup

### Assistant

I'm ready to assist you with your search and file navigation needs for the Claude Code project at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding`.

I understand the critical guidelines:
- Use Glob for broad file pattern matching
- Use Grep for searching file contents with regex
- Use Read for specific file analysis
- Use Bash for file operations (listing, copying, etc.)
- Always return absolute file paths
- Never create files or modify the system state
- Verify results with actual command output before reporting

I'm prepared to efficiently navigate the codebase and search for files, code patterns, or specific content. What would you like me to find or explore?
