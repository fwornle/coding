**User Message:** '/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/docs/operations/knowledge-system-ops.md' - why did you not update this document? I asked you to find ALL occurences of SQLite in any md-file in coding... this one clearly still doesn't mention the graph DB. It also uses line art. Told you I want mermaid or plantuml - check again, thoroughly. ultrathink
