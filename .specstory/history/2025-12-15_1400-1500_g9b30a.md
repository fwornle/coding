why did you not print the result of the git analysis (eg. # of insights - clickable to get to the list of insights)... similar for ALL nodes - I have asked for this a few times by now, yet you failed to implement this!\
Also, why is entity CODE not integrated in the git node? Isn't that the same? And why is it in parallel to "insights"? should the insights not come from analyzing code/git and vibe history, possibly enhanced by a web search? The entire DAG seems implausible.\

**User Request:** yes - make a detailed plan (stored persistently, so we can get back to it, should the session terminate unexpectedly), then implement

**Tool:** Task
**Input:** ```json
{
  "subagent_type": "Plan",
  "prompt": "Design a comprehensive implementation plan to fix the mcp-server-semantic-analysis multi-agent system.\n\n## Background Context\n\nThe mcp-server-semantic-analysis is located at `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/`. It's a TypeScript MCP server that coordinates 13 agents to analyze codebases and generate insights.\n\n### Critical Issues Identified\n\n1. **Code Graph Integration Broken** (Critical)\n   - File: `src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts`\n   - Method: `indexRepository()` at line 83-147\n   - Method: `runCodeGraphCommand()` at line 229-342\n   - Problem: Tries to run `uv run --directory <path> graph-code index` but fails silently, returning empty result with `skipped: true`\n   - Memgraph IS running (Docker verified), so the issue is in command execution\n   - The `codeGraphRagDir` property may have wrong path\n   - Error messages are swallowed and not surfaced\n\n2. **DAG Structure Logically Broken** \n   - File: `src/agents/coordinator.ts`\n   - Method: `initializeWorkflows()` at line 159-720\n   - Current workflow `complete-analysis` has `index_codebase` running in parallel but its results DON'T feed into `generate_insights`\n   - The `generate_insights` step receives git/vibe/semantic data but NOT code-graph data\n   - Dependencies need restructuring\n\n3. **Git Analysis Too Shallow**\n   - File: `src/agents/git-history-agent.ts`\n   - Method: `extractCodeEvolutionWithLLM()` at line 465-524\n   - Only analyzes first 50 commit MESSAGES (not code) with a single LLM call\n   - Should analyze actual code changes for significant commits\n\n4. **Missing Result Statistics in Output**\n   - File: `src/agents/coordinator.ts`  \n   - Method: `summarizeStepResult()` at line 2025-2084\n   - Method: `writeProgressFile()` at line 97-157\n   - Progress file doesn't include: insight names, pattern details, LLM call stats, clickable links\n   - Dashboard can't show meaningful statistics\n\n5. **No Agentic Loops**\n   - System is purely sequential - no retry logic for:\n     - Insufficient insight <USER_ID_REDACTED> → should trigger web search enhancement\n     - Failed code analysis → should retry with different parameters\n     - QA failures → limited recovery\n\n### Key Files to Modify\n\n1. `src/agents/coordinator.ts` - Workflow DAG restructuring, result reporting\n2. `src/agents/code-graph-agent.ts` - Fix indexRepository, better error handling\n3. `src/agents/git-history-agent.ts` - Deeper code analysis\n4. `src/agents/insight-generation-agent.ts` - Accept code-graph data as input\n\n### Existing Code Patterns\n\n- Workflows are defined in `initializeWorkflows()` with steps that have `dependencies` arrays\n- Steps use `{{step_name.result}}` template syntax to pass data\n- Agents expose methods like `analyzeGitHistoryWithLLM`, `indexRepository`, `generateComprehensiveInsights`\n- SemanticAnalyzer provides LLM access via `analyzeContent()` method with auto-fallback between providers\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. Code-graph must work - fix path issues, surface errors\n2. Code-graph results must feed into insight generation\n3. Progress file must show detailed statistics (insight count, names, patterns)\n4. Add agentic loop: if insights are sparse, trigger web search enhancement\n5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows\n\nPlease design a detailed implementation plan with:\n- Specific code changes needed\n- Order of implementation\n- Testing strategy\n- Rollback considerations",

**User Message:** not sure what you expected... but it ain't fully working: [Image #1] (eg. "vibe" only found 2 of the 700 odd LSL files / sessions)... vibe is looking for problem/solution pairs (--> why? this should be just a semantic analysis to figure out what broad goals we pursued, analyzed, implemented, designed, ...). Plus, why is node Code (= the code-graph-rag mcp server run?) runnning before git is executed? broken too. \

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
