### Assistant

The complete-analysis workflow partially completed (9/15 steps) before timing out.

**Completed Steps:**
- ✅ analyze_vibe_history
- ✅ analyze_git_history  
- ✅ link_documentation
- ✅ index_codebase
- ✅ transform_code_entities
- ✅ semantic_analysis
- ✅ web_search
- ✅ generate_insights
- ✅ generate_observations

**Failed:**
- ❌ analyze_documentation_semantics - timed out after 180s

**Remaining (not reached):**
- classify_entities
- quality_assurance
- deduplicate_entities
- content_validation
- refresh_stale_entities

The core analysis (git history, vibe/sessions, code indexing, semantic analysis, insights) completed successfully. The documentation semantics step timed out - this is a known slow step for large codebases.

Would you like me to:
1. Run an incremental analysis to finish the remaining steps
2. Manually trigger the remaining steps (classification, QA, deduplication, refresh)
3. Leave it as-is since the core knowledge extraction completed
