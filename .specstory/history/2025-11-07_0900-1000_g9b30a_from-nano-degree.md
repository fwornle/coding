## Prompt Set 1 (ps_1762504640264)

**Time:** 2025-11-07T08:37:20.264Z
**Duration:** 44340ms
**Tool Calls:** 3

### User

in coding, you just created this file: docs/CRITICAL-ukb-issues-analysis.md - however, in the documentation skill we told you to never use caps in any documenation artifacts (apart from README.md). Why did you not use this skill?

### Assistant

You're absolutely right to call this out. I apologize for not using the documentation skill when creating that file. Let me address both issues:

1. **Why I didn't use the skill**: I should have invoked the documentation skill before creating any documentation file. The skill would have provided guidelines including the naming convention to avoid CAPS (except README.md).

2. **The naming violation**: The file `docs/CRITICAL-ukb-issues-analysis.md` violates the no-CAPS rule.

Let me fix this immediately by:
1. Renaming the file to follow proper conventions
2. Using the documentation skill for future documentation work

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "cd /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding && mv docs/CRITICAL-ukb-issues-analysis.md docs/ukb-issues-analysis.md",
  "description": "Rename file to remove CAPS"
}
```

### Assistant

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "cd /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding && git add -A && git status",
  "description": "Stage renamed file and check status"
}
```

Good - the file has been renamed correctly. Now let me commit this fix:

### Assistant

**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\nfix: rename documentation file to follow naming conventions\n\nRenamed docs/CRITICAL-ukb-issues-analysis.md to docs/ukb-issues-analysis.md\nto comply with documentation standards (no CAPS except README.md).\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\"",

### Assistant

**Why I failed to use the skill:**

I made a mistake by not invoking the documentation skill before creating documentation. This was a procedural error on my part. Skills exist precisely to provide context-specific guidelines like naming conventions, and I should have used it.

**Going forward**: I will always invoke the relevant skill (documentation, in this case) before creating any artifacts in that domain to ensure I follow all established guidelines and conventions.

Thank you for catching this - it's exactly the kind of quality control that helps maintain consistency across the codebase.
