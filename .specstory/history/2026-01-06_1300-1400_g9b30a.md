**User Message:** also check all other agents - do they now all provide LLM info (i/p tokens, o/p tokens, cost - if available, model, etc.) and is this being displayed in trace mode?\
And why does it say groq,ollama? This is a log --> you either used a groq provided model or an ollama provided one --> you should say exactly what was used.
