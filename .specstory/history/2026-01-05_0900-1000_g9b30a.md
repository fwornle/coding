The current workflow (batch 23/23) died silently during `classify_with_ontology` step.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### Critical Issues Identified\n\n| Issue | Severity | File | Line(s) |\n|-------|----------|------|---------|\n| No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT) | CRITICAL | workflow-runner.ts | Missing |\n| No unhandledRejection handler | CRITICAL | workflow-runner.ts | Missing |\n| accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth | CRITICAL | coordinator.ts | 1712-2291 |\n| LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping | HIGH | OntologyClassifier.ts | 160 |\n| Background monitor lacks try-catch | HIGH | coordinator.ts | 3434-3438 |\n| Timeout promises leak timers | MEDIUM | coordinator.ts | 2772-2779 |\n| writeProgressFile swallows errors | MEDIUM | workflow-runner.ts | 56-62 |\n\n### Why Workflows Crash at High Batch Counts\n\n1. **Memory accumulation**: `accumulatedKG` grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)\n2. **No cleanup between batches**: Entities/relations never garbage collected\n3. **Silent failures**: Unhandled rejections crash without cleanup\n4. **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely without timeout enforcement\n\n## Solution Design\n\n### Phase 1: Process-Level Resilience (workflow-runner.ts)\n\nAdd signal handlers and global error catching:\n\n```typescript\n// Add at top of main() function\nprocess.on('SIGTERM', async () => {\n  log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');\n  writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });\n  await cleanup();\n  process.exit(130);\n});\n\nprocess.on('SIGINT', async () => {\n  log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');\n  writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });\n  await cleanup();\n  process.exit(130);\n});\n\nprocess.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {\n  log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });\n  writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });\n});\n\nprocess.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {\n  log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);\n  writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });\n  await cleanup();\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Memory Management (coordinator.ts)\n\nAdd periodic memory cleanup during batch processing:\n\n```typescript\n// Add memory compaction every N batches\nconst COMPACT_EVERY_N_BATCHES = 5;\n\nif (batchNumber % COMPACT_EVERY_N_BATCHES === 0) {\n  // Force garbage collection hint\n  if (global.gc) {\n    log(`Batch ${batch.id}: Triggering garbage collection`, 'debug');\n    global.gc();\n  }\n\n  // Log memory stats\n  const memUsage = process.memoryUsage();\n  log(`Batch ${batch.id}: Memory usage`, 'info', {\n    heapUsed: Math.round(memUsage.heapUsed / 1024 / 1024) + 'MB',\n    heapTotal: Math.round(memUsage.heapTotal / 1024 / 1024) + 'MB',\n    external: Math.round(memUsage.external / 1024 / 1024) + 'MB'\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Phase 3: LLM Timeout Enforcement (OntologyClassifier.ts)\n\nWrap LLM calls with explicit timeout:\n\n```typescript\nprivate async classifyWithLLM(text: string, options: ClassificationOptions): Promise<OntologyClassification | null> {\n  const LLM_TIMEOUT_MS = 30000;\n\n  const timeoutPromise = new Promise<never>((_, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('LLM classification timeout')), LLM_TIMEOUT_MS);\n  });\n\n  try {\n    const result = await Promise.race([\n      this.inferenceEngine.generateCompletion(prompt, { maxTokens: options.llmBudget }),\n      timeoutPromise\n    ]);\n    return this.parseClassificationResult(result);\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.message === 'LLM classification timeout') {\n      log('LLM classification timed out, falling back to heuristic', 'warn');\n      return null;  // Will use heuristic fallback\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Phase 4: Background Monitor Protection (coordinator.ts)\n\nWrap monitor in try-catch:\n\n```typescript\nthis.monitorIntervalId = setInterval(() => {\n  if (this.running) {\n    try {\n      this.monitorExecutions();\n    } catch (error) {\n      log('Monitor execution error (non-fatal)', 'error', error);\n    }\n  }\n}, 30000);\n```\n\n### Phase 5: Watchdog Timer (workflow-runner.ts)\n\nAdd maximum workflow duration watchdog:\n\n```typescript\nconst MAX_WORKFLOW_DURATION_MS = 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 2 hours max\n\nconst watchdogTimer = setTimeout(async () => {\n  log('[WorkflowRunner] Watchdog timeout - workflow exceeded max duration', 'error');\n  writeProgress(progressFile, {\n    status: 'failed',\n    error: `Watchdog timeout: workflow exceeded ${MAX_WORKFLOW_DURATION_MS / 1000 / 60} minutes`\n  });\n  await cleanup();\n  process.exit(1);\n}, MAX_WORKFLOW_DURATION_MS);\n\n// Clear watchdog on successful completion\nclearTimeout(watchdogTimer);\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `workflow-runner.ts` | Add signal handlers, unhandled rejection catching, watchdog timer |\n| `coordinator.ts` | Add memory monitoring, protect background monitor, add batch checkpointing |\n| `OntologyClassifier.ts` | Add explicit LLM timeout wrapping |\n| `persistence-agent.ts` | Add batch size limits for entity processing |\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Process signal handlers (immediate crash visibility)\n2. **Phase 5**: Watchdog timer (prevents indefinite hangs)\n3. **Phase 4**: Background monitor protection (prevents silent interval crashes)\n4. **Phase 3**: LLM timeout enforcement (prevents hang on classification)\n5. **Phase 2**: Memory management (prevents OOM on large batches)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. Kill workflow with `SIGTERM` - verify graceful shutdown\n2. Run workflow with `--max-old-space-size=256` - verify memory monitoring triggers\n3. Mock slow LLM response (>30s) - verify timeout kicks in\n4. Run 50+ batch workflow - verify memory stays bounded\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Workflows never hang indefinitely (watchdog ensures termination)\n- [ ] All crashes leave error state in progress file\n- [ ] Memory usage stays bounded regardless of batch count\n- [ ] LLM timeouts gracefully fall back to heuristics\n- [ ] Process signals trigger proper cleanup\n"

// 2 hours max\n\nconst watchdogTimer = setTimeout(async () => {\n  log('[WorkflowRunner] Watchdog timeout - workflow exceeded max duration', 'error');\n  writeProgress(progressFile, {\n    status: 'failed',\n    error: `Watchdog timeout: workflow exceeded ${MAX_WORKFLOW_DURATION_MS / 1000 / 60} minutes`\n  });\n  await cleanup();\n  process.exit(1);\n}, MAX_WORKFLOW_DURATION_MS);\n\n// Clear watchdog on successful completion\nclearTimeout(watchdogTimer);\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `workflow-runner.ts` | Add signal handlers, unhandled rejection catching, watchdog timer |\n| `coordinator.ts` | Add memory monitoring, protect background monitor, add batch checkpointing |\n| `OntologyClassifier.ts` | Add explicit LLM timeout wrapping |\n| `persistence-agent.ts` | Add batch size limits for entity processing |\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Process signal handlers (immediate crash visibility)\n2. **Phase 5**: Watchdog timer (prevents indefinite hangs)\n3. **Phase 4**: Background monitor protection (prevents silent interval crashes)\n4. **Phase 3**: LLM timeout enforcement (prevents hang on classification)\n5. **Phase 2**: Memory management (prevents OOM on large batches)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. Kill workflow with `SIGTERM` - verify graceful shutdown\n2. Run workflow with `--max-old-space-size=256` - verify memory monitoring triggers\n3.

// 2 hours max\n\nconst watchdogTimer = setTimeout(async () => {\n  log('[WorkflowRunner] Watchdog timeout - workflow exceeded max duration', 'error');\n  writeProgress(progressFile, {\n    status: 'failed',\n    error: `Watchdog timeout: workflow exceeded ${MAX_WORKFLOW_DURATION_MS / 1000 / 60} minutes`\n  });\n  await cleanup();\n  process.exit(1);\n}, MAX_WORKFLOW_DURATION_MS);\n\n// Clear watchdog on successful completion\nclearTimeout(watchdogTimer);\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `workflow-runner.ts` | Add signal handlers, unhandled rejection catching, watchdog timer |\n| `coordinator.ts` | Add memory monitoring, protect background monitor, add batch checkpointing |\n| `OntologyClassifier.ts` | Add explicit LLM timeout wrapping |\n| `persistence-agent.ts` | Add batch size limits for entity processing |\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Process signal handlers (immediate crash visibility)\n2. **Phase 5**: Watchdog timer (prevents indefinite hangs)\n3. **Phase 4**: Background monitor protection (prevents silent interval crashes)\n4. **Phase 3**: LLM timeout enforcement (prevents hang on classification)\n5. **Phase 2**: Memory management (prevents OOM on large batches)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n1. Kill workflow with `SIGTERM` - verify graceful shutdown\n2. Run workflow with `--max-old-space-size=256` - verify memory monitoring triggers\n3. Mock slow LLM response (>30s) - verify timeout kicks in\n4. Run 50+ batch workflow - verify memory stays bounded\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Workflows never hang indefinitely (watchdog ensures termination)\n- [ ] All crashes leave error state in progress file\n- [ ] Memory usage stays bounded regardless of batch count\n- [ ] LLM timeouts gracefully fall back to heuristics\n- [ ] Process signals trigger proper cleanup\n"

### Read - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "batch-023",
       "batchNumber": 23,
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:17:38.513Z",
       "steps": [
         {"name": "extract_batch_commits", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "extract_batch_sessions", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "batch_semantic_analysis", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "generate_batch_observations", "status": "completed"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     Missing steps: classify_with_ontology, kg_operators, batch_qa, save_batch_checkpoint

   - **workflow-runner-progress.json** - Shows last heartbeat info:
     ```json
     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",
       "message": "Executing batch-analysis... (heartbeat)",
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:13:34.397Z",
       "lastUpdate": "2026-01-05T06:17:34.841Z",
       "elapsedSeconds": 240,
       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts",
  "offset": 245,
  "limit": 100
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

### Edit - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Edit - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "batch-023",
       "batchNumber": 23,
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:17:38.513Z",
       "steps": [
         {"name": "extract_batch_commits", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "extract_batch_sessions", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "batch_semantic_analysis", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "generate_batch_observations", "status": "completed"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     Missing steps: classify_with_ontology, kg_operators, batch_qa, save_batch_checkpoint

   - **workflow-runner-progress.json** - Shows last heartbeat info:
     ```json
     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",
       "message": "Executing batch-analysis... (heartbeat)",
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:13:34.397Z",
       "lastUpdate": "2026-01-05T06:17:34.841Z",
       "elapsedSeconds": 240,
       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts",
  "old_string": "    }, 30000); // 30 seconds - well under the 120s stale threshold\n\n    // Execute the workflow",
  "new_string": "    }, 30000); // 30 seconds - well under the 120s stale threshold\n    cleanupState.heartbeatInterval = heartbeatInterval;\n\n    // Execute the workflow"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
The file <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:

### TodoWrite - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json

### Read - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "batch-023",
       "batchNumber": 23,
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:17:38.513Z",
       "steps": [
         {"name": "extract_batch_commits", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "extract_batch_sessions", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "batch_semantic_analysis", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "generate_batch_observations", "status": "completed"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     Missing steps: classify_with_ontology, kg_operators, batch_qa, save_batch_checkpoint

   - **workflow-runner-progress.json** - Shows last heartbeat info:
     ```json
     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",
       "message": "Executing batch-analysis... (heartbeat)",
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:13:34.397Z",
       "lastUpdate": "2026-01-05T06:17:34.841Z",
       "elapsedSeconds": 240,
       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",

       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Grep - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

### Edit - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "batch-023",
       "batchNumber": 23,
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:17:38.513Z",
       "steps": [
         {"name": "extract_batch_commits", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "extract_batch_sessions", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "batch_semantic_analysis", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "generate_batch_observations", "status": "completed"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     Missing steps: classify_with_ontology, kg_operators, batch_qa, save_batch_checkpoint

   - **workflow-runner-progress.json** - Shows last heartbeat info:
     ```json
     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",
       "message": "Executing batch-analysis... (heartbeat)",
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:13:34.397Z",
       "lastUpdate": "2026-01-05T06:17:34.841Z",
       "elapsedSeconds": 240,
       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/coordinator.ts",
  "old_string": "    this.monitorIntervalId = setInterval(() => {\n      if (this.running) {\n        this.monitorExecutions();\n      }\n    }, 30000);",
  "new_string": "    this.monitorIntervalId = setInterval(() => {\n      if (this.running) {\n        try {\n          this.monitorExecutions();\n        } catch (error) {\n          // Non-fatal: log error but don't crash the interval\n          log('Background monitor execution error (non-fatal)', 'error', error);\n        }\n      }\n    }, 30000);"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
The file <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/coordinator.ts has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:
  3430→    // Don't start if already running
  3431→    if (this.monitorIntervalId) {
  3432→      return;
  3433→    }
  3434→    this.monitorIntervalId = setInterval(() => {
  3435→      if (this.running) {
  3436→        try {
  3437→          this.monitorExecutions();
  3438→        } catch (error)

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });

     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..

### Read - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "batch-023",
       "batchNumber": 23,
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:17:38.513Z",
       "steps": [
         {"name": "extract_batch_commits", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "extract_batch_sessions", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "batch_semantic_analysis", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "generate_batch_observations", "status": "completed"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     Missing steps: classify_with_ontology, kg_operators, batch_qa, save_batch_checkpoint

   - **workflow-runner-progress.json** - Shows last heartbeat info:
     ```json
     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",
       "message": "Executing batch-analysis... (heartbeat)",
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:13:34.397Z",
       "lastUpdate": "2026-01-05T06:17:34.841Z",
       "elapsedSeconds": 240,
       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>.ts",
  "offset": 1,
  "limit": 50
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
     1→/**
     2→ * OntologyClassifier - Hybrid LLM + Heuristic entity classification
     3→ *
     4→ * Responsibilities:
     5→ * - Classify text/data into ontology entity classes

### Read - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json

       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Grep
**Input:** ```json
{
  "pattern": "// Call LLM$",
  "path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>.ts",
  "output_mode": "content",
  "-n": true
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
352:      // Call LLM
```

   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>.ts",
  "old_string": "      // Call LLM\n      const response = await this.inferenceEngine.generateCompletion({\n        messages: [\n          {\n            role: 'user',\n            content: prompt,\n          },\n        ],\n        maxTokens: 500,\n        temperature: 0.3,\n      });",

}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

### TodoWrite - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "batch-023",
       "batchNumber": 23,
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:17:38.513Z",
       "steps": [
         {"name": "extract_batch_commits", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "extract_batch_sessions", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "batch_semantic_analysis", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "generate_batch_observations", "status": "completed"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     Missing steps: classify_with_ontology, kg_operators, batch_qa, save_batch_checkpoint

   - **workflow-runner-progress.json** - Shows last heartbeat info:
     ```json
     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",
       "message": "Executing batch-analysis... (heartbeat)",
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:13:34.397Z",
       "lastUpdate": "2026-01-05T06:17:34.841Z",
       "elapsedSeconds": 240,
       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "batch-023",
       "batchNumber": 23,
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:17:38.513Z",
       "steps": [
         {"name": "extract_batch_commits", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "extract_batch_sessions", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "batch_semantic_analysis", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "generate_batch_observations", "status": "completed"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     Missing steps: classify_with_ontology, kg_operators, batch_qa, save_batch_checkpoint

   - **workflow-runner-progress.json** - Shows last heartbeat info:
     ```json
     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",
       "message": "Executing batch-analysis... (heartbeat)",
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:13:34.397Z",
       "lastUpdate": "2026-01-05T06:17:34.841Z",
       "elapsedSeconds": 240,
       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/coordinator.ts",

}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

### Edit - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer

     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** TodoWrite
**Input:** ```json
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts",
      "status": "completed",

### Bash - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:

     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')

1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "batch-023",
       "batchNumber": 23,

         {"name": "generate_batch_observations", "status": "completed"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     Missing steps: classify_with_ontology, kg_operators, batch_qa, save_batch_checkpoint

   - **workflow-runner-progress.json** - Shows last heartbeat info:
     ```json
     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",
       "message": "Executing batch-analysis... (heartbeat)",
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:13:34.397Z",

       "elapsedSeconds": 240,
       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts",
  "old_string": "  log('[WorkflowRunner] Cleanup already in progress, skipping duplicate', 'warn');",
  "new_string": "  log('[WorkflowRunner] Cleanup already in progress, skipping duplicate', 'warning');"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
The file <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:

### Grep - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "replace_all": true,
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts",

  "new_string": ", 'warning')"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
The file <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts has been updated. All occurrences of ', 'warn')' were successfully replaced with ', 'warning')'.

### Bash - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Edit
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts",
  "old_string": "      log('[WorkflowRunner] Failed to update timing statistics', 'warn', {\n        status: response.status\n      });",
  "new_string": "      log('[WorkflowRunner] Failed to update timing statistics', 'warning', {\n        status: response.status\n      });"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```
The file <AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:

### Edit - 2026-01-05 08:08:35 UTC [09:08:35 CEST]

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to capture all key details:

1. **Initial Context**: The conversation was a continuation from a previous session that implemented time-based progress estimation for UKB workflows. That work was completed (scripts/seed-step-timing-statistics.js, server.js API endpoints, ukbSlice.ts Redux state, ukb-workflow-modal.tsx progress calculation with ETA display).

2. **User's New Request**: User reported a frozen workflow (batch 23/23 stuck on classify_with_ontology step, Health: Frozen, Last heartbeat: 3620s ago). They asked to:
   - Check logs and determine root cause
   - Propose a strategy to avoid such issues
   - Make a plan

3. **Investigation Phase**: I conducted extensive investigation:
   - Checked workflow-progress.json - showed batch 23 had only 4 of 8 steps completed
   - Process 36371 was no longer running
   - No PID files found
   - Workflow-runner-progress.json showed last update at 06:17:34
   - Batch-progress.json showed batch 23 status "processing" with operators pending
   - Explored coordinator.ts and workflow-runner.ts error handling
   - Explored ontology classification system for hang points

4. **Root Causes Identified**:
   - No process signal handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
   - No unhandledRejection handler
   - accumulatedKG unbounded memory growth
   - LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Background monitor lacks try-catch

5. **Plan Mode**: Created comprehensive plan with 5 phases:
   - Phase 1: Process signal handlers
   - Phase 5: Watchdog timer
   - Phase 4: Background monitor protection
   - Phase 3: LLM timeout enforcement
   - Phase 2: Memory management

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:

6. **Plan Approved**: User approved the plan, todo list created, ready to start implementation.

Key files to modify:
- workflow-runner.ts
- coordinator.ts
- OntologyClassifier.ts

Current todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user reported a frozen UKB workflow that got "stuck again" and noted "this happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this." The user explicitly requested:
   - Check the logs and determine the root cause of the issue
   - Propose a strategy which would avoid such issues
   - Make a plan for implementation

   The screenshot showed:
   - Workflow: Batch Analysis at batch 23/23
   - Health: Frozen
   - Elapsed: 1h 4m
   - Progress: 85% at "classify_with_ontology" step
   - Last heartbeat: 3620s ago (about 1 hour)
   - Step Status: Completed: 14, Running: 0, Failed: 0, Pending: 0

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Node.js process signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, uncaughtException)
   - Memory management in long-running batch processes
   - Promise.race for timeout enforcement on LLM calls
   - Watchdog timers for maximum workflow duration
   - Background interval callback error handling
   - accumulatedKG data structure growing unbounded during batch workflows
   - OntologyClassifier LLM calls without explicit timeout wrapping
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup patterns

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **workflow-progress.json** - Shows batch 23 with only 4 of 8 steps completed before crash:
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "batch-023",
       "batchNumber": 23,
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:17:38.513Z",
       "steps": [
         {"name": "extract_batch_commits", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "extract_batch_sessions", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "batch_semantic_analysis", "status": "completed"},
         {"name": "generate_batch_observations", "status": "completed"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     Missing steps: classify_with_ontology, kg_operators, batch_qa, save_batch_checkpoint

   - **workflow-runner-progress.json** - Shows last heartbeat info:
     ```json
     {
       "workflowId": "wf_1767593613838_1jn0c9",
       "status": "running",
       "message": "Executing batch-analysis... (heartbeat)",
       "startTime": "2026-01-05T06:13:34.397Z",
       "lastUpdate": "2026-01-05T06:17:34.841Z",
       "elapsedSeconds": 240,
       "pid": 36371
     }
     ```

   - **workflow-runner.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/) - Needs signal handlers, watchdog timer:
     - Currently has no SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
     - No unhandledRejection handler
     - Only cleanup in finally blocks, but no protection against crashes
     - Heartbeat interval clears correctly in finally block

   - **coordinator.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/) - Needs memory monitoring, protected background monitor:
     - Line 3434-3438: Background monitor lacks try-catch
     - Line 1712-2291: accumulatedKG grows unbounded
     - Line 2282-2287: kgOperators.applyAll processes growing accumulatedKG

   - **OntologyClassifier.ts** (integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/ontology/) - Needs LLM timeout wrapping:
     - Line 160: LLM call without explicit timeout
     - Line 382: batchClassify uses Promise.all for parallel processing

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Workflow silently crashed**: Process 36371 died without proper error reporting
     - Root cause: No signal handlers or unhandled rejection catching
     - Fix planned: Add process.on('SIGTERM'), process.on('SIGINT'), process.on('unhandledRejection'), process.on('uncaughtException')
   
   - **Memory accumulation**: accumulatedKG grows with each batch (269 entities, 2492 relations by batch 22)
     - Fix planned: Add periodic memory monitoring and GC hints every 5 batches

   - **LLM hangs**: Classification calls can hang indefinitely
     - Fix planned: Wrap LLM calls with Promise.race timeout (30s)

5. Problem Solving:
   - **Investigation completed**: Identified that workflow crashed during/before classify_with_ontology step on batch 23
   - **Root causes identified**: 7 critical issues documented in plan
   - **Solution designed**: 5-phase implementation plan created and approved
   - **Ready to implement**: Todo list created with Phase 1 (signal handlers) marked as in_progress

6. All user messages:
   - "the currently 'running' wf got stuck again. This happens regularly - there might be a data (volume) dependency it seems which causes this? check the logs and determine the root cause of this issue. Then propose a strategy which would avoid such issues (and make a plan)" [with screenshot of frozen workflow]

7. Pending Tasks (from todo list):
   - [in_progress] Phase 1: Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 5: Add watchdog timer to workflow-runner.ts
   - [pending] Phase 4: Protect background monitor in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Phase 3: Add LLM timeout enforcement in OntologyClassifier.ts
   - [pending] Phase 2: Add memory monitoring in coordinator.ts
   - [pending] Build and verify changes compile

8. Current Work:
   Investigation and planning is complete. The plan was approved by the user. A todo list was created with the implementation phases. Phase 1 (Add process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts) is marked as in_progress but no code has been written yet.

   The approved plan includes these specific code changes for Phase 1 (workflow-runner.ts):
   ```typescript
   process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGTERM received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process terminated (SIGTERM)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] SIGINT received, graceful shutdown', 'warn');
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: 'Process interrupted (SIGINT)' });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(130);
   });

   process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Unhandled rejection', 'error', { reason });
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Unhandled rejection: ${reason}` });
   });

   process.on('uncaughtException', async (error) => {
     log('[WorkflowRunner] Uncaught exception', 'error', error);
     writeProgress(progressFile, { status: 'failed', error: `Uncaught: ${error.message}` });
     await cleanup();
     process.exit(1);
   });
   ```

9. Optional Next Step:
   Begin implementing Phase 1 by adding process signal handlers to workflow-runner.ts at `<AWS_SECRET_REDACTED>ns/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/workflow-runner.ts`. The plan specifies adding SIGTERM, SIGINT, unhandledRejection, and uncaughtException handlers at the top of the main() function..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -t /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5",
  "description": "Find newest session log files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

}
```

**Result:** ❌ Error
**Output:** ```

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**User Request:** # Read session logs for continuity

Read the last session log for continuity. If $ARGUMENTS is given, read the last $ARGUMENTS session log files from both local and coding project histories.

## Steps - Non-Coding Projects (e.g., nano-degree, curriculum-alignment)

1. Infer current project name from working directory path (pwd)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files using ls -t
3. Find and read the latest (n) coding/.specstory/history/*_from-<project>.md files using ls -t
4. Summarize sessions to provide continuity of awareness and actions

## Steps - Coding Project

1. Confirm we're in coding project (pwd shows /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding)
2. Find and read the newest (n) local .specstory/history/*.md files (WITHOUT _from- postfix) using ls -t
3. Find and read ALL redirected files from ALL projects:
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-nano-degree.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-curriculum-alignment.md (last n)
   - coding/.specstory/history/*_from-*.md (any other projects, last n each)
4. Summarize all sessions to provide comprehensive continuity across all project work

## Implementation Notes

- Project name can be inferred from pwd (e.g., /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree → nano-degree)
- Session filenames follow pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>.md`
- Cross-project logs: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM-HHMM_<userid-hash>_from-<project>.md`
- Local sessions in current project's .specstory/history directory
- Redirected sessions in /Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/ directory
- Use `ls -t` to find newest files (already auto-approved)
- Focus on understanding both local and cross-project work completed

## Auto-Approval Note

Use ONLY auto-approved commands: pwd, ls -t
Avoid: git commands, basename - these may trigger approval prompts

## Expected Behavior

### In Non-Coding Projects

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Determine current project name** from directory path
2. **Find local session logs** in current project's .specstory/history/
3. **Find redirected logs** in coding/.specstory/history/\*_from-PROJECT.md (where PROJECT is current project name)
4. **Read and summarize** the most recent (n) logs from both sources
5. **Present combined summary** showing both local and redirected work

### In Coding Project

When executed, Claude Code should:

1. **Confirm coding project** from directory path
2. **Find local coding logs** WITHOUT _from- postfix (regular coding sessions)
3. **Find ALL redirected logs** from all projects (*_from-*.md)
4. **Read last (n) from each source** (n local coding + n per redirected project)
5. **Present comprehensive summary** showing:
   - Direct coding infrastructure work
   - Cross-project work done from all projects
   - Holistic view of all development activities

**Tool:** Read
**Input:** ```json
{
  "file_path": "/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.specstory/history/2026-01-05_0800-0900_g9b30a.md",
  "offset": 500,
  "limit": 500
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success
**Output:** ```

**User Message:** why does the progress offer a "nealy fixed relative" ETA? (approx. 2 mins, see screenshot... although this was displayed for approx. 7 minutes, then jumped to "0")... this doesn't seem to work (same holds for the progress bar... remains below 25%, then jumps to the end - check the statistical estimates... maybe the averaging is not done in the right way... should this maybe be a median?

**Assistant Response:** Good catch - the ETA and progress bar are clearly not working correctly. At batch 23/23 with "final validation" running, showing 14% progress is wrong. Let me investigate the calculation logic.

### Text Exchange - 2026-01-05 08:43:39 UTC [09:43:39 CEST]

**User Message:** the tracer still doesn't show every step (each batch iteration) - we did a signifiant refactoring (today, see LSLs / above in this chat) to make this happen... seems to not yet work. Also, there are no insights found, nothing out of the ontology classification, 0 LLMs, ... there seem to be quite a few issues still.
