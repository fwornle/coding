### Text Exchange - 2025-11-15 05:02:07 UTC [06:02:07 CEST]

**User Message:** it seems that some process is active and keeps creating a .specstory/history/* tree in our test installation at ~/Agentic/coding-tmp/coding - this should not happen, as the only active coding session is the one started from ~/Agentic/coding!! Seems that the session registration mechanism does not properly monitor the active sessions. ultrathink and analyze this critical fault - you'd need to look for the management of this file '/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/coding/.global-lsl-registry.json'...

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

**User Message:** the problem still seems to persist - do I have to quit all coding session (= this one) for the fix to become active? Will this ensure that all coding related processes are stopped?\
