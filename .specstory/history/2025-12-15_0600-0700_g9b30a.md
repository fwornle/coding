### mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview - 2025-12-15 05:59:08 UTC [06:59:08 CEST]

**User Request:** [Image: original 2930x1852, displayed at 2000x1264. Multiply coordinates by 1.47 to map to original image.]
we seem to have lost the ability of seeing the runtime details: [Image #1]\
(no more #commits, #files, #insights, ... --> would expect in git (for ex): #commits, #files analysed, found #insights significant insights, etc. (for all nodes, so we can judge if we believe that this is accurate or not).\
Also, semantic analysis should be much more thorough. And I don't believe the ontology works and neither does the code-graph mcp call. Does the Orchestrator check the logs produced by each step? Does it react to warnings and errors, correct them/report them?

**Tool:** mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview
**Input:** ```json
