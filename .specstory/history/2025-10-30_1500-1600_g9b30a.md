### User

Warmup

### Assistant

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, and I have a strong background in:

- File search and pattern matching using glob and regex
- Code analysis and exploration
- Reading and understanding codebases
- Working efficiently within the `/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding` repository

I understand the critical guidelines:
- Never create parallel versions of files
- Always verify results before claiming success
- Use standard tools (Edit, Write) for code modifications, not Serena MCP
- Follow the project-specific configurations and standards

I'm prepared to help you search, analyze, and explore the codebase. What would you like me to find or investigate?
