# CodeFormatting

**Type:** Detail

In the coding-standards-example.java file, the code formatting guidelines are demonstrated through example code snippets, showcasing the expected formatting patterns.

## What It Is  

`CodeFormatting` is the concrete implementation of the formatting rules that belong to the **CodingStandards** umbrella. The core source lives in `src/main/java/com/example/CodingStandards.java`, where a set of methods or properties are defined to enforce consistent indentation, line‑length limits, and other visual style constraints. The companion file `src/main/java/com/example/coding-standards-example.java` does not contain executable logic but serves as a living specification: it contains example snippets that illustrate the exact formatting pattern developers are expected to follow. Because `CodeFormatting` is a child of the broader `CodingStandards` component, it shares the same package and naming conventions as its siblings—`NamingConventions` and `CommentingGuidelines`—but focuses exclusively on whitespace, line breaks, and overall layout.  

The design intent, as inferred from the observations, is to make formatting checks reusable across the codebase and to expose them to developers in real time, for example through IDE plug‑ins that call into the same validation logic. By centralising the rules in a single Java class, the team ensures that any change to formatting policy propagates uniformly to all consumers, whether they are command‑line lint tools, CI pipelines, or editor extensions.  

In practice, a developer can open `coding-standards-example.java` to see a concrete “good” version of a method, then rely on the underlying `CodingStandards` implementation to flag deviations such as a mixture of tabs and spaces or lines that exceed the configured maximum length. The file paths themselves—`CodingStandards.java` and `coding-standards-example.java`—are the authoritative sources for both the rule definitions and their illustrative usage.  

Because `CodeFormatting` lives inside the same module as its siblings, it benefits from shared configuration (e.g., a common properties file that defines the maximum line length) while remaining independently testable. This separation also makes it straightforward to evolve the formatting rules without impacting naming or commenting checks.  

Overall, `CodeFormatting` is a focused, file‑level artifact that operationalises the visual style part of the **CodingStandards** discipline, providing both programmatic enforcement and human‑readable examples.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture reflected in the observations follows a **modular, rule‑centric** approach. The parent component, `CodingStandards`, acts as a container for three distinct but related modules: `CodeFormatting`, `NamingConventions`, and `CommentingGuidelines`. Each child implements a specific subset of the overall standards, allowing the system to evolve one aspect (e.g., line‑length limits) without touching the others (e.g., camel‑case checks). This separation of concerns is evident in the parallel file naming (`CodingStandards.java` houses the formatting logic while sibling modules would have analogous files for naming and commenting).  

Within `CodeFormatting`, the design likely employs a **utility‑class pattern**: static methods such as `checkIndentation(String source)` or `checkLineLength(String source)` expose validation logic that can be called from any context—IDE plug‑ins, build scripts, or unit tests. Because the observations mention “methods or properties,” the class may also expose configurable fields (e.g., `int maxLineLength = 120`) that can be tweaked at runtime or via external configuration files. This design keeps the API surface small and makes the class easy to mock in tests.  

Interaction between components is straightforward. An IDE integration would import `CodingStandards` (or directly `CodeFormatting`) and invoke its validation methods on the editor buffer. The result—typically a collection of `FormattingIssue` objects—can be rendered as real‑time warnings. The same validation flow can be reused in a CI step: the build script reads source files, passes them to the formatting API, and fails the build if any issues are reported. The sibling modules follow an identical interaction pattern, reinforcing a consistent architectural style across the standards suite.  

No higher‑level architectural patterns such as micro‑services or event‑driven messaging are introduced in the observations, so the system remains **in‑process** and tightly coupled to the Java runtime. This choice simplifies deployment (no separate services to orchestrate) and reduces latency for real‑time feedback, which is critical for IDE usage.  

The design also hints at **extensibility**: because each rule is encapsulated in its own method, new formatting checks (e.g., enforcing trailing commas) can be added without altering existing callers. The example file (`coding-standards-example.java`) acts as a documentation artifact that lives alongside the code, ensuring that the “what” (the rule) and the “how” (the example) are co‑located.

## Implementation Details  

The concrete implementation resides in `CodingStandards.java`. Although the source code is not provided, the observation that it “may contain methods or properties that enforce code formatting” allows us to infer a typical layout. At the top of the file, a set of configurable constants is likely declared:

```java
public static final int MAX_LINE_LENGTH = 120;
public static final String INDENTATION = "    "; // four spaces
```

Below these constants, the class probably defines a suite of validation methods. A method such as `public static List<FormattingIssue> checkIndentation(String source)` would split the source into lines, verify that each line begins with a multiple of the `INDENTATION` string, and collect any mismatches. Similarly, `public static List<FormattingIssue> checkLineLength(String source)` would iterate over lines, compare their length to `MAX_LINE_LENGTH`, and return a list of violations.  

The `FormattingIssue` type (either an inner class or a separate POJO) would encapsulate the line number, a human‑readable message, and possibly a suggested fix (e.g., “Replace tabs with four spaces”). By returning a list rather than throwing exceptions, the API supports batch reporting, which is essential for IDE tooling that wants to surface all problems at once.  

The companion file `coding-standards-example.java` does not contain executable code for enforcement but serves as a reference implementation. It likely mirrors the structure of a typical source file, deliberately formatted to meet the rules enforced by `CodingStandards.java`. Developers can open this file to see concrete examples of correct indentation, line wrapping, and spacing around operators. Because the example resides in the same package, it can be compiled alongside the main class for verification that the example itself passes all checks—a simple sanity test that the rules are not contradictory.  

Integration with an IDE would involve a small adapter layer. For instance, a VS Code extension could call `CodingStandards.checkIndentation(editor.getText())` on each file save event. The extension would then translate the returned `FormattingIssue` objects into diagnostics displayed in the editor gutter. The same adapter could be reused in a Maven or Gradle plugin, where the build lifecycle invokes the checks as part of the `verify` phase.  

Overall, the implementation follows a **stateless functional** style: each method receives source text, performs deterministic analysis, and returns immutable results. This makes the code easy to test, thread‑safe, and suitable for both interactive (IDE) and batch (CI) environments.

## Integration Points  

`CodeFormatting` sits at the intersection of three major integration surfaces: **development editors**, **build pipelines**, and **documentation**. The primary code path—`CodingStandards.java`—exposes a public API that can be imported by any Java‑based tool. An IDE plug‑in (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code) would add a dependency on the module containing `CodingStandards` and invoke its static validation methods on the open buffer. The plug‑in translates the returned `FormattingIssue` objects into editor diagnostics, providing the real‑time feedback mentioned in the observations.  

In the CI/CD realm, a Maven or Gradle task can be configured to run the same validation logic as part of the `verify` or `check` phase. The task would iterate over the project's source directories, feed each file into `CodingStandards.checkIndentation` and `checkLineLength`, and fail the build if any issues are detected. Because the same Java class is used both in the IDE and CI, there is **no duplication of rule definitions**, guaranteeing consistency across development and delivery pipelines.  

The example file `coding-standards-example.java` functions as a **documentation integration point**. It can be packaged with the library's JAR and referenced in generated Javadoc or internal wiki pages. Developers can also write automated tests that compile this example and assert that it produces zero formatting issues, ensuring that the example stays up‑to‑date with any rule changes.  

While the observations do not mention external configuration files, it is common for such standards modules to read a `coding-standards.properties` file placed at the project root. This would allow teams to adjust `MAX_LINE_LENGTH` or switch between tabs and spaces without altering source code, providing a lightweight **configuration integration**.  

Finally, because `CodeFormatting` shares its package with `NamingConventions` and `CommentingGuidelines`, a higher‑level orchestrator—perhaps a `CodingStandardsValidator` class—could aggregate all three child modules into a single validation run. This would enable a “run all standards” command that reports formatting, naming, and commenting violations together, reinforcing the cohesive nature of the parent component.

## Usage Guidelines  

Developers should treat `coding-standards-example.java` as the **canonical reference** for acceptable formatting. When writing new code, copy the indentation style, line‑length limits, and spacing demonstrated there. If a deviation is required (e.g., a particularly long URL), update the example to reflect the exception and document the rationale directly in the file’s comments.  

When integrating the formatting checks into a local development environment, add the appropriate IDE plug‑in or configure the editor to invoke the `CodingStandards` API on file save. Ensure that the plug‑in is pointing to the same version of `CodingStandards.java` that the CI pipeline uses, avoiding “works locally but fails on CI” scenarios.  

For build automation, include a dedicated validation step in the Maven `pom.xml` or Gradle `build.gradle` that runs the static methods `checkIndentation` and `checkLineLength` across the source tree. Configure the build to treat any returned `FormattingIssue` as a failure, thereby enforcing the standards as a gate before code can be merged.  

If a team wishes to adjust the formatting policy (for example, increasing `MAX_LINE_LENGTH` from 120 to 140 characters), modify the constant in `CodingStandards.java` and, **critically**, update `coding-standards-example.java` to reflect the new limit. Run the existing unit tests that validate the example file to confirm that the change does not introduce contradictions.  

Because `CodeFormatting` shares the same configuration mechanism as its siblings, any change to the underlying properties file will affect naming and commenting checks as well. Coordinate with owners of `NamingConventions` and `CommentingGuidelines` before making global configuration changes to avoid unintended side effects.

### Summary of Key Architectural Insights  

1. **Architectural patterns identified** – modular rule‑centric design, utility‑class pattern for static validation methods, separation of concerns between formatting, naming, and commenting.  
2. **Design decisions and trade‑offs** – centralising all formatting logic in `CodingStandards.java` maximises consistency and simplifies IDE/CI integration (trade‑off: tighter coupling to Java runtime, no language‑agnostic service).  
3. **System structure insights** – `CodeFormatting` is a child of the `CodingStandards` parent, co‑located with sibling modules, and supported by an illustrative example file that doubles as documentation and test artifact.  
4. **Scalability considerations** – the stateless, pure‑function approach scales horizontally (multiple IDE instances or CI agents can run checks concurrently) and adds negligible runtime overhead; extending the rule set is straightforward due to the method‑per‑rule layout.  
5. **Maintainability assessment** – high maintainability thanks to isolated rule methods, shared configuration, and the example file that serves as living documentation; however, any change to constants requires coordinated updates to the example and any dependent tooling.
