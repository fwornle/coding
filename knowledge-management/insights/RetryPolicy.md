# RetryPolicy

**Type:** Detail

RetryPolicy (service-starter.ts:45) implements exponential backoff to retry failed services, utilizing the `calculateBackoff` function in backoff-strategy.js to determine the optimal retry interval.

## What It Is  

`RetryPolicy` is a concrete policy object that governs how failed service start‑up attempts are retried inside the **ServiceStarter** subsystem. The implementation lives in two places that work together: the TypeScript definition at **service‑starter.ts:45** and the JavaScript helper at **lib/service‑starter.js**. The core entry point is the `startServiceWithRetry` function in *lib/service‑starter.js*, which applies the policy’s exponential‑backoff rules when a service fails to launch. The policy’s calculations are delegated to the `calculateBackoff` function found in *backoff‑strategy.js*. In the broader architecture, this retry capability is a key safeguard for the **DockerizedServices** component, helping to keep services available and to stop failures from propagating through the system.

## Architecture and Design  

The design follows a **policy‑driven retry architecture**. `RetryPolicy` encapsulates the retry parameters (such as maximum attempts, base delay, and backoff factor) while the `startServiceWithRetry` routine acts as the executor that applies those parameters. By separating the *policy* (the “what” – how many retries, how the interval grows) from the *executor* (the “how” – the actual looping and error handling), the code adheres to the **Separation of Concerns** principle.  

The use of the `calculateBackoff` function in *backoff‑strategy.js* introduces a lightweight **Strategy** element: the backoff algorithm can be swapped or tuned without touching the retry loop itself. This modularity is evident from the observation that `RetryPolicy` “utilizes the `calculateBackoff` function … to determine the optimal retry interval.”  

Interaction flow:  

1. **ServiceStarter** invokes `startServiceWithRetry` (lib/service‑starter.js).  
2. `startServiceWithRetry` constructs or receives a `RetryPolicy` instance (service‑starter.ts:45).  
3. For each retry attempt, it calls `calculateBackoff` (backoff‑strategy.js) to compute the delay, then pauses before the next launch attempt.  

This chain keeps the retry logic isolated from the rest of the service‑starting code, allowing the DockerizedServices component to rely on a consistent, well‑defined failure‑handling contract.

## Implementation Details  

- **`startServiceWithRetry` (lib/service‑starter.js)** – This function wraps the actual service start call in a retry loop. It reads the retry configuration from a `RetryPolicy` instance and, on failure, sleeps for the interval returned by `calculateBackoff`. The loop continues until either the service starts successfully or the policy’s maximum‑retry count is exhausted.  

- **`RetryPolicy` (service‑starter.ts:45)** – Defined in TypeScript, this class (or plain object) holds the parameters that drive the exponential backoff: a base delay, a multiplier (often 2), and a ceiling on retry attempts. Its responsibility is limited to exposing these values; the heavy lifting of interval calculation is delegated.  

- **`calculateBackoff` (backoff‑strategy.js)** – A pure function that receives the current attempt number and the policy’s base parameters, then returns `baseDelay * (multiplier ^ attempt)` (or a capped value). Because it is a standalone function, it can be unit‑tested in isolation and swapped if a different backoff algorithm is needed.  

Together, these pieces implement an **exponential backoff** pattern: each successive retry waits longer, reducing the likelihood of overwhelming a failing downstream service and giving it time to recover. The design also ensures that the retry interval is “optimal” as described, by centralising the calculation logic.

## Integration Points  

`RetryPolicy` is tightly coupled with the **ServiceStarter** component, which is its parent in the hierarchy. ServiceStarter calls `startServiceWithRetry`, passing the policy instance, so any change to the policy’s shape directly impacts ServiceStarter’s behaviour. The retry mechanism also serves the **DockerizedServices** component; the observation notes that the policy “is crucial for maintaining service availability and preventing cascading failures” there. Consequently, DockerizedServices depends on ServiceStarter’s reliability, and through it, on the retry policy.  

The only external dependency explicitly mentioned is the `calculateBackoff` function from *backoff‑strategy.js*. This file acts as a shared utility that could be reused by other components needing backoff logic, though no sibling usage is observed. The interface between ServiceStarter and the retry policy is simple: the executor reads configuration values (maxAttempts, baseDelay, multiplier) and invokes the backoff calculator.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Instantiate or configure `RetryPolicy`** with sensible defaults (e.g., a modest base delay and a maximum of 5 attempts) before passing it to `startServiceWithRetry`. Because the policy directly influences service availability, avoid setting the retry count too high, which could delay failure detection.  

2. **Do not modify `calculateBackoff`** unless a new backoff strategy is required. If you need a different algorithm (e.g., jittered backoff), implement a new function and update the reference in `RetryPolicy` rather than altering the existing logic.  

3. **Handle final failure** after the retry loop exits. `startServiceWithRetry` will surface an error once the policy’s limit is hit; callers in ServiceStarter should log the failure and trigger any higher‑level fallback or alerting mechanisms.  

4. **Keep the policy immutable** during a single start operation. Changing parameters mid‑retry can lead to unpredictable intervals and should be avoided.  

5. **Unit‑test the backoff calculation** independently using the `calculateBackoff` function to verify that the exponential growth behaves as expected for edge cases (e.g., zero attempts, maximum delay caps).

### Summary of Requested Items  

1. **Architectural patterns identified** – Policy‑driven retry architecture, Separation of Concerns, Strategy (via `calculateBackoff`).  
2. **Design decisions and trade‑offs** – Encapsulation of retry parameters in `RetryPolicy` vs. flexibility of swapping backoff strategies; exponential backoff reduces load on failing services but adds latency to recovery.  
3. **System structure insights** – `RetryPolicy` is a child of **ServiceStarter**, which itself is the parent for the retry executor; the policy is a shared utility for the DockerizedServices component.  
4. **Scalability considerations** – Exponential backoff limits rapid retry storms, helping the system scale under failure conditions; however, the maximum retry count must be tuned to avoid long‑running start attempts that could block resource allocation.  
5. **Maintainability assessment** – Clear separation of policy, executor, and backoff calculation makes the codebase easy to test and evolve; the limited coupling (only through well‑defined interfaces) supports straightforward updates and replacement of the backoff algorithm.
