# ViolationFilter

**Type:** Detail

The captureViolation() function in violation-capture.js likely utilizes a filtering mechanism to exclude duplicate violations, potentially leveraging a data structure like a Set or Map to track unique...

## What It Is  

`ViolationFilter` is the dedicated filtering component that lives inside the **ViolationCaptureService**. Its implementation is hinted at by the `captureViolation()` function found in **`violation-capture.js`** – this function is responsible for ingesting raw violation data emitted by the various tooling integrations and then delegating to the filter to decide whether a violation should be recorded. The filter’s primary role is to enforce uniqueness: it examines incoming violation metadata (type, entity ID, timestamp, etc.) and discards duplicates before the data proceeds to downstream components such as **ViolationStorage** or **ViolationNotification**. By being a separate module or class within the service, `ViolationFilter` can be swapped or extended without touching the capture logic itself.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture follows a **modular, layered design** where the **ViolationCaptureService** orchestrates three sibling responsibilities: filtering (`ViolationFilter`), persisting (`ViolationStorage`), and notifying (`ViolationNotification`). The observations describe `ViolationFilter` as a **stand‑alone module/class** that the capture service invokes, which is a classic example of the **Strategy pattern** – the capture service delegates the “how to filter” decision to a pluggable strategy object.  

Interaction flow (as inferred from the hierarchy):  

1. A tool interaction triggers `captureViolation()` in **`violation-capture.js`**.  
2. `captureViolation()` hands the raw violation to the `ViolationFilter`.  
3. The filter evaluates the violation’s metadata against an internal uniqueness store (likely a `Set` or `Map`).  
4. If the violation is deemed unique, control returns to the capture service, which then forwards the payload to **ViolationStorage** for persistence and to **ViolationNotification** for broadcasting.  

The sibling **ViolationNotification** is described as leveraging a “messaging or event‑driven architecture,” indicating that once the filter passes a violation, the notification path may emit an event or push a message onto a queue, while **ViolationStorage** focuses on durable storage concerns.

## Implementation Details  

* **`captureViolation()` (violation-capture.js)** – This function acts as the entry point for all violation data. Its internal logic is expected to call into `ViolationFilter` before any further processing. The observation that it “likely utilizes a filtering mechanism to exclude duplicate violations” suggests the function contains a call such as `if (violationFilter.shouldCapture(violation)) { … }`.  

* **`ViolationFilter` (module/class inside ViolationCaptureService)** – The filter is presumed to maintain an in‑memory collection (e.g., `new Set()` or `new Map()`) keyed by a composite of the violation’s type, entity ID, and timestamp. When `shouldCapture(violation)` is invoked, the filter constructs this composite key, checks the collection for existence, and either adds the key (allowing the violation to proceed) or returns `false` (dropping the duplicate). This approach provides O(1) lookup time and keeps the filter lightweight.  

* **Metadata Comparison** – The filter’s decision logic compares fields explicitly mentioned in the observations: *violation type*, *entity ID*, and *timestamp*. By focusing on these attributes, the filter can differentiate between truly identical events (duplicate reports) and distinct violations that happen close in time but affect different entities.  

* **Extensibility** – Because `ViolationFilter` is a separate module, developers can replace the default uniqueness strategy with a more sophisticated one (e.g., time‑windowed de‑duplication) without altering `captureViolation()` or the surrounding service.

## Integration Points  

* **Parent – ViolationCaptureService** – The service owns the filter instance and calls it from `captureViolation()`. The service also coordinates the hand‑off to the storage and notification siblings after a successful filter pass.  

* **Sibling – ViolationStorage** – Receives only those violations that have survived the filter. The storage component is responsible for persisting the data, likely using a database or file system as described.  

* **Sibling – ViolationNotification** – Consumes filtered violations to emit events, webhooks, or queue messages. The observation that it “potentially leverages webhooks, callbacks, or message queues” means the filter indirectly influences the volume of outbound traffic.  

* **External Interfaces** – The filter itself does not appear to expose a public API beyond the internal `shouldCapture` method used by `captureViolation()`. Its only dependency is the structure of the violation object (type, entity ID, timestamp), which must be consistently supplied by the tooling integrations.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Do not bypass the filter** – All code that generates a violation must route through `captureViolation()`; this guarantees that duplicate suppression is applied uniformly.  
2. **Maintain consistent metadata** – The uniqueness check hinges on the presence and correctness of `type`, `entityId`, and `timestamp`. Ensure every violation payload includes these fields with stable naming.  
3. **Extend with care** – If a new filtering rule is required (e.g., ignoring certain violation types), implement it inside `ViolationFilter` rather than modifying `captureViolation()`. This keeps the separation of concerns intact.  
4. **Monitor the in‑memory store** – Because the filter likely uses a `Set`/`Map`, very high violation rates could increase memory pressure. Consider periodic pruning or size limits if the system operates at scale.  
5. **Testing** – Unit tests for `ViolationFilter` should cover duplicate detection, edge cases around timestamp granularity, and proper handling of missing metadata to avoid accidental loss of legitimate violations.

### Architectural patterns identified  
* **Strategy pattern** – `ViolationFilter` is a pluggable strategy for de‑duplication used by `ViolationCaptureService`.  
* **Modular layered architecture** – Clear separation between capture, filter, storage, and notification responsibilities.  

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  
* **In‑memory uniqueness store** (Set/Map) provides fast O(1) look‑ups but consumes heap memory; suitable for moderate traffic but may need eviction logic under heavy load.  
* **Separate filter module** improves testability and replaceability, at the cost of an additional indirection layer in the capture flow.  

### System structure insights  
* The system is organized around a central **ViolationCaptureService** that coordinates three sibling components, each handling a distinct cross‑cutting concern (filtering, persistence, notification).  
* `ViolationFilter` acts as the gatekeeper, ensuring downstream components only see unique, well‑formed violations.  

### Scalability considerations  
* **Memory footprint** of the filter grows with the number of unique violation keys; scaling horizontally (multiple service instances) would duplicate this store unless a shared cache (e.g., Redis) is introduced.  
* **Throughput** is limited by the speed of the in‑memory lookup; this is generally negligible but could become a bottleneck if the rate of incoming violations approaches millions per second.  

### Maintainability assessment  
* The clear separation of concerns and the encapsulated filter module make the codebase easy to understand and evolve.  
* Because the filter’s logic is simple (metadata comparison), future developers can quickly add new criteria or replace the implementation without ripple effects.  
* The only maintainability risk lies in the implicit reliance on the structure of the violation object; any change to field names must be reflected across the capture and filter code.


## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [ViolationCaptureService](./ViolationCaptureService.md) -- ViolationCaptureService uses the captureViolation() function in the violation-capture.js file to capture violations from tool interactions

### Siblings
- [ViolationStorage](./ViolationStorage.md) -- ViolationStorage would likely utilize a database or file storage system to persist captured violations, with potential considerations for data serialization, indexing, and querying
- [ViolationNotification](./ViolationNotification.md) -- ViolationNotification would likely utilize a messaging or event-driven architecture to notify the dashboard of new violations, potentially leveraging webhooks, callbacks, or message queues
