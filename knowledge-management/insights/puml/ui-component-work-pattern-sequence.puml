title UI Component Work Pattern Sequence

actor "User" as user
participant "UI Controller" as controller
participant "Component Manager" as manager
participant "UI Component" as component
participant "Work Handler" as handler
database "Component State" as state

user -> controller: initiate UI interaction

    activate component
    
    component -> handler: process component work
    activate handler
    
    handler -> state: update component state
    activate state
    state --> handler: state updated
    deactivate state
    
    handler --> component: work completed
    deactivate handler
    
    component --> manager: pattern execution complete
    deactivate component
end

manager --> controller: component work finished
