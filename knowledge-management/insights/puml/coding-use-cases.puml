note right of viz
  Primary interface through
  'vkb' command for knowledge
  base visualization
end note

note bottom of sync
  Automated sync between
  Graphology + LevelDB and
  JSON export format
end note

note right of semantic
  Recent architectural improvement
  with parallel worker implementation
  for batch processing
end note
