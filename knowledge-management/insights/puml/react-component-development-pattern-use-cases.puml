title React Component Development Pattern - Use Cases

' Define actors
actor Developer as dev
actor "React Developer" as reactdev
actor "UI Designer" as designer
actor "Project Manager" as pm

' Define system boundary
rectangle "React Component Development System" {
  
  ' Core development use cases
  usecase "Create Component" as UC1
  usecase "Implement Component Logic" as UC2
  usecase "Design Component Interface" as UC3
  usecase "Test Component" as UC4
  usecase "Refactor Component" as UC5
  usecase "Document Component" as UC6
  
  ' Supporting use cases
  usecase "Validate Props" as UC7
  usecase "Handle State Management" as UC8
  usecase "Implement Event Handlers" as UC9
  usecase "Apply Styling" as UC10
  
  ' Management use cases
  usecase "Review Component Quality" as UC11
  usecase "Track Development Progress" as UC12
}

' Actor relationships
reactdev --> UC1 : initiates
reactdev --> UC2 : implements
reactdev --> UC4 : executes
reactdev --> UC5 : performs
reactdev --> UC6 : creates

designer --> UC3 : defines
designer --> UC10 : specifies

pm --> UC11 : conducts
pm --> UC12 : monitors

dev --> UC1 : participates
dev --> UC2 : codes
