' User interactions
Dev --> Terminal : claude-mcp
Dev --> Browser : http://localhost:8080

' Main flow
Terminal --> Launcher : starts
Launcher --> Claude : starts Claude session
Claude --> MCP : JSON-RPC transport
Claude --> Logger : triggers post-session processing

' MCP Server connections
MCP <--> MemoryMCP : memory operations\n(CRUD, search)
MCP <--> BrowserMCP : browser automation\n(navigate, extract)

' Logging flow
Logger --> SpecStory : post-session analysis\nand smart content routing

' Knowledge management flow  
Terminal --> UKB : manual invocation
UKB --> SharedMem : updates knowledge graph
UKB --> Insights : generates documentation
VKB --> SharedMem : reads for visualization
VKB --> Viz : serves web interface
Browser --> Viz : displays knowledge graph

' External integrations
BrowserMCP --> Chrome : DevTools Protocol
BrowserMCP --> Web : automated browsing
MemoryMCP --> SharedMem : persistent storage

' Version control
SharedMem --> Git : git tracking
SpecStory --> Git : conversation history
Insights --> Git : documentation

note right of Logger : ✅ WORKING: Post-session processing\nfor automatic conversation logging\nwith content-aware routing\n\nFully operational and reliable

note bottom of MCP : MCP servers run as separate\nprocesses communicating via\nJSON-RPC over stdio

note right of MemoryMCP : Provides tools:\n- add_entity\n- create_relation\n- search_memory

note right of BrowserMCP : Provides tools:\n- navigate\n- extract_content\n- take_screenshot
