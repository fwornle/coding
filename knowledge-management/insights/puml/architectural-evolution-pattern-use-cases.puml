gdb_service --> store
gdb_service --> query
exporter --> export
api_client --> integrate

manage_db --> store : stores at .data/knowledge-graph
export --> sync : auto-sync to .data/knowledge-export
integrate --> api : communicates with

visualize --> query
develop --> query
sync --> store

note right of manage_db : Uses Graphology + LevelDB
note right of export : Auto-synchronizes JSON exports
note right of integrate : Component-based architecture
