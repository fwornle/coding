# DockerModelRunner

**Type:** Detail

The DockerModelRunner's implementation in lib/llm/docker-model-runner.ts likely includes logic for creating, starting, and stopping Docker containers for LLM models.

## What It Is  

`DockerModelRunner` is a TypeScript class that lives in **`lib/llm/docker-model-runner.ts`**.  Its sole responsibility is to encapsulate the lifecycle of a Docker container that hosts a locally‑run large‑language‑model (LLM).  By placing the implementation in a dedicated file under the `llm` folder, the codebase signals a modular approach: the runner is a self‑contained unit that can be imported wherever a local LLM needs to be executed.  The class is used directly by the **`LocalLLM`** component, which delegates the actual model execution to `DockerModelRunner`.  In practice, developers interact with `LocalLLM`; the runner works behind the scenes to spin up a container, feed it input, collect output, and tear the container down when the job is finished.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture that emerges from the observations is a **container‑oriented isolation layer**.  `DockerModelRunner` acts as an abstraction over Docker’s API, shielding the rest of the system from the complexities of container management.  This reflects a classic *Facade* pattern: the runner presents a simple, high‑level interface (e.g., “run model”, “stop”) while internally handling the creation, start, and stop operations for Docker containers.  Because `LocalLLM` holds a reference to `DockerModelRunner`, the relationship can be described as a *composition* where `LocalLLM` composes the runner as a child component.  The design deliberately separates concerns—`LocalLLM` focuses on model‑level semantics (prompt handling, tokenization, etc.), whereas `DockerModelRunner` concentrates on the operational concerns of container lifecycle.

The containerization strategy itself is a **deployment isolation pattern**.  By executing each LLM inside its own Docker image, the system avoids version conflicts, ensures reproducible environments, and limits the impact of a misbehaving model on the host process.  The runner therefore becomes the bridge between the pure‑JavaScript/TypeScript domain of the application and the native Docker runtime.

## Implementation Details  

While the source file does not expose concrete symbols, the observations tell us that `DockerModelRunner` “likely includes logic for creating, starting, and stopping Docker containers for LLM models.”  In practical terms, the class probably:

1. **Initialises a Docker client** (e.g., using the `dockerode` library or a native Docker CLI wrapper) when it is instantiated.  
2. **Defines a method to launch a container** based on a pre‑built image that contains the desired LLM binaries and their runtime dependencies.  This method would configure volume mounts, environment variables, and resource limits (CPU/memory) required by the model.  
3. **Provides a run‑loop or request handler** that streams input data (prompts) into the container’s stdin or via an exposed HTTP/gRPC endpoint, then captures the model’s output.  
4. **Implements graceful shutdown logic**, ensuring that containers are stopped and removed after a job completes or when an error occurs, thereby preventing orphaned processes.  

Because `DockerModelRunner` resides under `lib/llm/`, it is logically grouped with other language‑model‑related utilities, reinforcing the modular design.  The class is a child of `LocalLLM`; any changes to the runner’s API will ripple to `LocalLLM`, which must adapt its own methods accordingly.

## Integration Points  

The primary integration point is the **`LocalLLM`** component, which holds a reference to `DockerModelRunner`.  `LocalLLM` likely constructs the runner, passes configuration (such as the Docker image tag, model parameters, or hardware constraints), and invokes its methods to execute inference.  From a dependency perspective, `DockerModelRunner` depends on the host’s Docker daemon and any Node.js Docker client library it uses.  It also implicitly depends on the existence of a correctly built Docker image that contains the LLM binaries; this image is an external artifact that must be maintained alongside the codebase.

Other parts of the system that may interact with the runner include configuration modules (providing paths, environment variables), logging facilities (capturing container stdout/stderr), and error‑handling utilities that translate Docker‑level failures into domain‑specific exceptions for `LocalLLM`.  Because the runner abstracts Docker, higher‑level code does not need to import Docker‑specific types, preserving a clean separation.

## Usage Guidelines  

When using `LocalLLM`, developers should treat `DockerModelRunner` as an internal detail and avoid direct interaction unless a custom container lifecycle is required.  The runner expects that the Docker daemon is reachable and that the target image is present on the host; therefore, deployment scripts should ensure the image is built or pulled before any inference request.  Because container start‑up can add latency, callers may want to **reuse a running container** for multiple inference calls when the underlying model supports it, or implement a pooling strategy at the `LocalLLM` level.

Error handling is crucial: any Docker‑related exception (e.g., image not found, out‑of‑memory) should be caught by `DockerModelRunner` and surfaced as a clear, domain‑specific error to the caller.  Developers should also respect resource limits; configuring CPU and memory caps in the runner prevents a single model from exhausting host resources.  Finally, when shutting down the application, ensure that `DockerModelRunner` is given a chance to clean up any lingering containers to avoid resource leaks.

### Architectural patterns identified
* **Facade** – `DockerModelRunner` hides Docker API complexity behind a simple interface.  
* **Composition** – `LocalLLM` composes the runner as a child component.  
* **Deployment Isolation (Containerization)** – each LLM runs inside its own Docker container.

### Design decisions and trade‑offs
* **Isolation vs. Overhead** – Containers provide reproducible environments and safety but introduce start‑up latency and resource consumption.  
* **Modularity** – Placing the runner in its own file (`docker-model-runner.ts`) improves testability and allows independent evolution, at the cost of an extra abstraction layer.  
* **Dependency on Docker** – Guarantees environment consistency but ties the system to a host with Docker installed.

### System structure insights
* The system is layered: high‑level LLM logic (`LocalLLM`) sits atop a low‑level container manager (`DockerModelRunner`).  
* All LLM‑related code lives under `lib/llm/`, reinforcing a clear domain boundary.

### Scalability considerations
* Because each inference can spin up a separate container, horizontal scaling is possible by running multiple containers in parallel, limited only by host CPU/memory.  
* Reusing containers or implementing a pool can mitigate start‑up costs and improve throughput.

### Maintainability assessment
* The clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain; updates to Docker handling affect only `docker-model-runner.ts`.  
* However, reliance on external Docker images introduces a maintenance surface (image versioning, compatibility) that must be tracked alongside the source code.  
* Providing a well‑documented interface in `DockerModelRunner` will reduce coupling and simplify future refactors.
