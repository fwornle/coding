# WorkflowLayoutComputer

**Type:** SubComponent

WorkflowLayoutComputer supports dynamic workflow changes through its updateLayout function in workflow-layout-computer.ts, which recalculates the layout in response to changes

## What It Is  

**WorkflowLayoutComputer** is a sub‑component that lives in the **ConstraintSystem** module and is implemented in the file `workflow-layout-computer.ts`.  Its purpose is to translate a set of workflow agents—objects that implement the `WorkflowAgent` interface defined in `workflow-agent.ts`—into a visual or logical layout that respects both the hierarchical relationships of the workflow and the visibility rules of each agent.  The component builds an internal **graph model** (via its child **GraphModeler**) that captures dependencies between agents, runs a topological‑sorting algorithm to order them, and then produces a layout that can be consumed by the rest of the system.  To keep the layout calculation responsive, it caches previously computed results in `workflow-layout-cache.ts` and exposes a callback mechanism so that interested listeners are notified whenever the layout changes.

## Architecture and Design  

The design of **WorkflowLayoutComputer** follows a **modular, graph‑centric architecture**.  The component is a self‑contained unit inside the larger **ConstraintSystem** (the parent), alongside sibling sub‑components such as **StatisticsCalculator**, **ContentValidationAgent**, and **ViolationCaptureService**.  While those siblings focus on aggregation, rule‑based validation, and event capture respectively, **WorkflowLayoutComputer** concentrates on structural analysis of workflow agents, illustrating a clear separation of concerns within the parent.

### Core architectural elements  

| Element | Role | Evidence |
|--------|------|----------|
| **GraphModeler** (child) | Encapsulates the graph‑based data structure that represents workflow dependencies. | “WorkflowLayoutComputer contains GraphModeler.” |
| **Topological sorting** | Guarantees a deterministic, dependency‑respecting order of agents before layout is produced. | “The layout computation algorithm … is based on a topological sorting approach.” |
| **Caching layer** (`workflow‑layout‑cache.ts`) | Stores pre‑computed layouts to avoid recomputation on unchanged sub‑graphs. | “The sub‑component uses a caching mechanism … to store pre‑computed layouts and improve performance.” |
| **Callback mechanism** | Publishes layout updates to registered listeners, enabling reactive UI or downstream processing. | “Provides a callback mechanism … for notifying listeners about layout changes and updates.” |
| **Update entry point** (`updateLayout`) | Reacts to dynamic workflow changes, recomputes only the affected portion of the graph. | “Supports dynamic workflow changes through its updateLayout function … recalculates the layout in response to changes.” |

The component therefore employs **graph‑based modeling** and **dependency‑driven ordering** as its primary design patterns.  The caching strategy is a classic **memoization** pattern, while the callback system implements a lightweight **observer** pattern.  All of these are confined to the sub‑component’s own files, keeping the public surface small and the internal implementation interchangeable.

## Implementation Details  

### 1. Data Modeling (`workflow-layout-computer.ts` & GraphModeler)  
The workflow is represented as a directed graph where nodes correspond to concrete implementations of the `WorkflowAgent` interface (found in `workflow-agent.ts`).  Edges denote “must execute before” or “depends on” relationships.  **GraphModeler** supplies utilities for adding nodes, linking dependencies, and exposing the adjacency list needed for sorting.

### 2. Layout Computation (`computeLayout`)  
`computeLayout` is the core function that:

1. **Filters agents by visibility** – agents that are hidden for the current user or context are excluded early, reducing graph size.  
2. **Invokes topological sort** – the graph is traversed using a depth‑first or Kahn’s algorithm (the exact algorithm is not spelled out, but the observation guarantees a topological ordering). The resulting linear order respects all declared dependencies.  
3. **Applies hierarchy rules** – after sorting, the function injects hierarchical constraints (e.g., grouping child agents under parent containers) to produce a final layout structure.  
4. **Caches the result** – the computed layout is stored in `workflow-layout-cache.ts` keyed by a hash of the visible agent set and the dependency graph. Subsequent identical calls hit the cache and bypass the expensive sorting step.  

### 3. Dynamic Updates (`updateLayout`)  
When the workflow graph changes—agents added, removed, or visibility toggled—`updateLayout` is called. It performs a **partial invalidation** of the cache (only the affected sub‑graph) and re‑runs `computeLayout` for the changed portion, preserving previously cached results for unchanged sections. This incremental approach balances responsiveness with correctness.

### 4. Notification System  
Consumers (e.g., UI renderers or downstream services) register callbacks through an exposed API. After each successful layout computation or update, the component iterates over the registered listeners and invokes them with the new layout payload. This decouples the layout engine from its consumers and mirrors an **observer** pattern without a heavyweight event bus.

### 5. Interaction with `WorkflowAgent`  
All agents must implement the `WorkflowAgent` contract, which likely defines methods such as `getId()`, `isVisible()`, and `getDependencies()`. By depending on this interface, **WorkflowLayoutComputer** remains agnostic to the concrete agent implementations, enabling future extension with new agent types without modifying the layout engine.

## Integration Points  

1. **Parent – ConstraintSystem**  
   - `ConstraintSystem` instantiates **WorkflowLayoutComputer** and orchestrates its lifecycle alongside other sub‑components.  
   - The parent may invoke `computeLayout` during initial system boot and `updateLayout` when constraint violations trigger workflow modifications.

2. **Sibling Components**  
   - While **StatisticsCalculator**, **ContentValidationAgent**, and **ViolationCaptureService** operate on different concerns (statistics, content rules, event capture), they share the same modular loading pattern within `ConstraintSystem`.  
   - The layout engine may receive input from **ViolationCaptureService** (e.g., a new violation that introduces a required remediation step) and therefore needs to recompute the layout.

3. **Child – GraphModeler**  
   - All graph‑related operations are delegated to **GraphModeler**, keeping the layout logic clean and focused on ordering and rendering concerns.  
   - Any change to the graph representation (e.g., switching from adjacency list to adjacency matrix) would be isolated within **GraphModeler**, leaving `computeLayout` untouched.

4. **Caching Layer (`workflow-layout-cache.ts`)**  
   - The cache is a private module that **WorkflowLayoutComputer** reads from and writes to. It is not exposed to other components, preserving encapsulation.  
   - The cache key strategy is derived from the set of visible agents and their dependency edges, ensuring that identical workflow states reuse existing layouts.

5. **External Listeners**  
   - Any module that cares about layout changes registers a callback via the provided API. Typical consumers could be a front‑end rendering service, a reporting engine, or a diagnostic logger.

## Usage Guidelines  

1. **Always work through the public API** – call `computeLayout` for initial layout generation and `updateLayout` when the workflow graph changes. Direct manipulation of the internal graph or cache is discouraged to avoid stale state.  

2. **Respect the `WorkflowAgent` contract** – when adding new agents, implement all required members (visibility, dependency enumeration). Incomplete implementations will break the topological sort and may cause runtime errors.  

3. **Leverage caching wisely** – the cache is keyed automatically; however, developers should avoid forcing a full recompute by unnecessarily toggling agent visibility or rebuilding the entire graph when only a small subset changes. Use `updateLayout` with the minimal set of changed agents.  

4. **Register callbacks early** – if a component depends on layout updates (e.g., UI), register its listener right after the **WorkflowLayoutComputer** instance is created. This ensures that the first layout computation is not missed.  

5. **Avoid circular dependencies** – because the algorithm relies on a topological sort, any circular dependency introduced via `WorkflowAgent.getDependencies()` will cause the sort to fail. Validation of the dependency graph should be performed before invoking `computeLayout`.  

6. **Testing** – unit tests should mock the `WorkflowAgent` interface and verify that the ordering respects dependencies, visibility filtering works, and cache hits are exercised. Integration tests can exercise `updateLayout` with incremental changes to confirm that only the affected sub‑graph is recomputed.

### Summary of Insights  

| Aspect | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| **Architectural patterns identified** | Graph‑based modeling, topological sorting, caching (memoization), observer (callback) pattern, interface‑driven design (`WorkflowAgent`). |
| **Design decisions and trade‑offs** | Choosing a directed graph enables expressive dependency modeling at the cost of needing cycle detection. Topological sort guarantees correct ordering but requires a well‑formed DAG. Caching improves performance for static sub‑graphs but adds cache‑invalidation complexity when workflows mutate. The callback mechanism decouples layout generation from consumers but introduces asynchronous notification handling. |
| **System structure insights** | **WorkflowLayoutComputer** sits under **ConstraintSystem**, encapsulating its own child **GraphModeler** while sharing the parent’s modular loading approach with siblings. The component is a pure computation engine with no side‑effects beyond cache writes and listener notifications. |
| **Scalability considerations** | The graph representation scales linearly with the number of agents; topological sort is O(V + E). Caching mitigates repeated work for large, mostly static workflows. Incremental `updateLayout` limits recomputation to changed sub‑graphs, supporting workflows that evolve at runtime without full re‑processing. |
| **Maintainability assessment** | High maintainability thanks to clear separation: graph handling (`GraphModeler`), layout logic (`computeLayout`/`updateLayout`), caching (`workflow-layout-cache.ts`), and external notification (callbacks). The reliance on the `WorkflowAgent` interface isolates changes to agent implementations. Potential maintenance hotspots are cache invalidation logic and ensuring DAG integrity; these are well‑contained within the component. |

The **WorkflowLayoutComputer** therefore provides a robust, extensible foundation for deriving deterministic layouts from complex, dynamic workflow definitions while staying neatly integrated within the broader **ConstraintSystem** architecture.

## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [ConstraintSystem](./ConstraintSystem.md) -- The ConstraintSystem component utilizes a modular design, with sub-components such as the ContentValidationAgent and the ViolationCaptureService, each responsible for a specific aspect of constraint enforcement. For instance, the ContentValidationAgent, located in integrations/mcp-server-semantic-analysis/src/agents/content-validation-agent.ts, uses filePathPatterns and commandPatterns to extract references from entity content, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns. This modular approach allows for easier maintenance and updates, as each sub-component can be modified or extended independently without affecting the overall system.

### Children
- [GraphModeler](./GraphModeler.md) -- The WorkflowLayoutComputer uses a graph-based data structure to model workflow dependencies, as described in the parent context.

### Siblings
- [StatisticsCalculator](./StatisticsCalculator.md) -- StatisticsCalculator uses a data aggregation approach in statistics-calculator.ts to compute statistics from violation history
- [ContentValidationAgent](./ContentValidationAgent.md) -- ContentValidationAgent uses a rules-based approach in content-validation-agent.ts to validate entity content against predefined constraints
- [ViolationCaptureService](./ViolationCaptureService.md) -- ViolationCaptureService uses a event-driven approach in violation-capture-service.ts to capture and process constraint violations
