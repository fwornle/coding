# CacheInvalidation

**Type:** Detail

CacheInvalidation (cache-config.js:25) implements a time-to-live (TTL) mechanism, automatically expiring cache entries after a specified time period

## What It Is  

`CacheInvalidation` is a concrete implementation that lives inside **`cache-config.js`** (see observations at lines 15, 25 and 30).  It is the piece of logic responsible for keeping the Redis‑backed cache consistent: when a cache entry is updated the `cacheInvalidation` method is invoked (line 15) to explicitly delete the stale key, and a time‑to‑live (TTL) policy is also applied (line 25) so that entries automatically expire after a configured interval.  The implementation directly uses the **Redis** client library (line 30) to issue the necessary `DEL`/`EXPIRE` commands against the Redis store.  `CacheInvalidation` is a child of the **`CacheManager`** component, which orchestrates overall caching behavior for the application.

## Architecture and Design  

The architecture follows a **centralised cache‑management module** pattern: all Redis‑related concerns (connection, interface, invalidation, TTL) are co‑located in `cache-config.js`.  `CacheInvalidation` itself is a **behavioural function** (`cacheInvalidation`) that is called by the parent `CacheManager` whenever data that is cached is mutated.  This creates a clear **caller‑callee relationship** – `CacheManager → CacheInvalidation` – ensuring that cache consistency is enforced at the point of data change.  

Sibling components, **`CacheInterface`** (line 10) and **`RedisConnection`** (line 5), also import the Redis library and establish the underlying connection.  By sharing the same connection configuration, the three siblings avoid duplicated connection logic and present a unified façade to the rest of the system.  The design therefore leans on **module‑level encapsulation** rather than classic OO patterns; the only “pattern” explicitly observable is the **Cache‑Invalidation pattern** (explicit deletion plus TTL) implemented as a set of functions in a single configuration file.

## Implementation Details  

* **Connection Setup** – `RedisConnection` (line 5) imports the Redis client and creates a connection using a configuration object (`RedisConnection configuration`).  This connection object is then reused by `CacheInterface` and `CacheInvalidation`.  

* **Cache Interface** – `CacheInterface` (line 10) also imports the Redis library, acting as a thin wrapper that other parts of the codebase use to read/write cache entries.  It does not perform invalidation itself; instead it delegates that responsibility to `CacheInvalidation`.  

* **Invalidation Method** – The core of `CacheInvalidation` is the `cacheInvalidation` method defined at line 15.  When invoked, it receives the key (or keys) that have become stale and issues a Redis `DEL` command to remove them immediately.  Because the method lives in the same file as the connection logic, it can directly reference the shared Redis client without additional indirection.  

* **TTL Mechanism** – At line 25 the same module sets a TTL on cache entries, typically by calling Redis `EXPIRE` or by using the `SET … EX PX` syntax when the entry is first written.  This automatic expiration works in parallel with explicit invalidation, providing a safety net for any entries that might be missed by manual deletion.  

* **Invocation Flow** – The parent `CacheManager` monitors data‑mutation events (e.g., database updates) and triggers `cacheInvalidation` (line 15) as part of its update workflow.  This ensures that any cached representation of the mutated data is promptly removed, after which subsequent reads will repopulate the cache with fresh data.

## Integration Points  

`CacheInvalidation` integrates with three primary entities:

1. **`CacheManager` (parent)** – Calls `cacheInvalidation` whenever a cacheable resource is updated.  This tight coupling means that any change in the invalidation contract (e.g., additional parameters) must be reflected in `CacheManager`’s update handling code.  

2. **`CacheInterface` (sibling)** – Provides the read/write API used throughout the application.  While `CacheInterface` does not invoke invalidation directly, it benefits from the TTL logic that `CacheInvalidation` applies to newly written entries.  

3. **`RedisConnection` (sibling)** – Supplies the underlying Redis client instance.  Because all three components import the same library and configuration, they share a single connection pool, reducing connection overhead and ensuring consistent connection settings (host, port, authentication).  

No other external dependencies are mentioned, so the integration surface is limited to the Redis client library and the internal `cache-config.js` module.

## Usage Guidelines  

* **Always invoke `cacheInvalidation` via `CacheManager`** – Direct calls from other modules bypass the intended orchestration and can lead to inconsistent cache states.  Follow the established update pipeline: data mutation → `CacheManager` → `cacheInvalidation`.  

* **Respect TTL settings** – When writing new entries through `CacheInterface`, rely on the TTL mechanism defined in `CacheInvalidation` (line 25) rather than hard‑coding expiration values elsewhere.  This centralises expiration policy and makes future adjustments straightforward.  

* **Do not duplicate Redis connections** – All cache‑related code should import the shared Redis client from `RedisConnection`.  Creating additional connections in unrelated modules defeats the connection‑sharing design and can exhaust Redis resources.  

* **Handle errors gracefully** – The Redis client may raise connection or command errors.  Wrap calls to `cacheInvalidation` in try/catch blocks and log failures, allowing the application to continue operating with a potentially stale cache rather than crashing.  

* **Test invalidation paths** – Unit tests for `CacheManager` should verify that after a data update, the corresponding Redis key is removed.  Integration tests should also confirm that TTL expiry occurs as expected, ensuring both manual and automatic invalidation work together.

### Architectural Patterns Identified
1. **Cache‑Invalidation pattern** (explicit delete + TTL).  
2. **Module‑level encapsulation** – all cache concerns reside in a single configuration file (`cache-config.js`).  
3. **Shared connection façade** – `RedisConnection` provides a single Redis client used by siblings.

### Design Decisions and Trade‑offs
* **Centralised configuration** simplifies maintenance but reduces modular testability.  
* **Using Redis as the sole cache store** offers fast, distributed access but introduces a single point of failure if not clustered.  
* **Combining explicit invalidation with TTL** balances immediate consistency (delete) against eventual cleanup (TTL), at the cost of managing two mechanisms.

### System Structure Insights
* Hierarchy: `CacheManager` (parent) → `CacheInvalidation` (child).  
* Siblings (`CacheInterface`, `RedisConnection`) share the same Redis client, reinforcing a tightly‑coupled cache subsystem within `cache-config.js`.  
* No separate files or symbols for invalidation; everything is co‑located, indicating a deliberately flat module structure.

### Scalability Considerations
* **Redis** inherently supports horizontal scaling via clustering; `CacheInvalidation` will continue to work as long as the client is pointed at the cluster endpoint.  
* TTL offloads expiration work to Redis itself, reducing application‑side processing.  
* However, the single `cache-config.js` module could become a bottleneck if many services import and invoke `cacheInvalidation` concurrently; careful connection‑pool sizing and possible refactoring into a dedicated service may be needed for very high throughput.

### Maintainability Assessment
* **High maintainability** for small‑to‑medium codebases because all cache logic lives in one place; changes to invalidation or TTL affect the whole system instantly.  
* **Potential fragility** as the module grows: lack of separation of concerns may make unit testing harder and increase the risk of accidental side‑effects when modifying one part of the file.  
* Documentation and strict adherence to the usage guidelines mitigate these risks, ensuring that developers interact with the cache subsystem through the intended `CacheManager` pathway.


## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [CacheManager](./CacheManager.md) -- CacheManager uses a caching library, such as Redis, to interact with the cache, as defined in the cache-config.js file

### Siblings
- [CacheInterface](./CacheInterface.md) -- The CacheInterface (cache-config.js:10) imports the Redis library, establishing a connection to the Redis cache store
- [RedisConnection](./RedisConnection.md) -- The cache-config.js file (Line 5) imports the Redis library and establishes a connection to the Redis cache store using the RedisConnection configuration
