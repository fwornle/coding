# ComponentReusableUiBuildingBlocks
**Type:** general
**Generated:** 2026-01-20T07:18:57.319Z

## Pattern Overview
ComponentReusableUiBuildingBlocks is a development pattern that supports the codebase with key implementations in `purge-knowledge-entities.js`, `coding.json`, `ui.json`. It Check `purge-knowledge-entities. This is a high-significance pattern that should be understood before making related changes.

**Significance:** 9/10

## Evidence
- When working with component in this codebase, changes often span multiple modules. Key files: `purge-knowledge-entities.js`, `coding.json`, `ui.json`
- Reusable UI building blocks. This pattern was established to ensure system reliability and maintainability at scale
- DO: Check `purge-knowledge-entities.js`, `coding.json`, `ui.json` when modifying component behavior. DON'T: Make isolated changes without verifying related modules
- This component pattern is applicable when building JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, TypeScript systems with critical reliability requirements
