**Type:** general
**Generated:** 2026-01-20T07:18:50.134Z

## Pattern Overview
PromiseHandlesAsynchronousOperations is a development pattern that supports the codebase with key implementations in `combined-status-line.js`, `health-verifier.js`, `2025-06-16_13-32Z-clarification-on-code-assistance-request.md`. It Check `combined-status-line. This is a high-significance pattern that should be understood before making related changes.

**Significance:** 9/10

## Evidence
- When working with promise in this codebase, changes often span multiple modules. Key files: `combined-status-line.js`, `health-verifier.js`, `2025-06-16_13-32Z-clarification-on-code-assistance-request.md`
Handles asynchronous operations. This pattern was established to manage asynchronous operations and prevent callback complexity
DO: Check `combined-status-line.js`, `health-verifier.js`, `2025-06-16_13-32Z-clarification-on-code-assistance-request.md` when modifying promise behavior. DON'T: Make isolated changes without verifying related modules
This promise pattern is applicable when building JavaScript, Markdown, TypeScript systems with critical reliability requirements
