# QueryInterface

**Type:** Detail

The graph-database-config.js file contains configuration settings for the graph database, such as the database URL, username, and password, which are used by the QueryInterface module to establish a c...

## What It Is  

`QueryInterface` is the concrete module that mediates every Cypher‑language request to the underlying graph store.  In the codebase it lives in its own source file – `query‑interface.ts` – and its sole responsibility is to expose a thin, typed API that higher‑level services (most notably **GraphDatabaseManager**) can call when they need to read or write graph data.  The module does not contain hard‑coded connection details; instead it imports the runtime configuration that lives in `graph‑database‑config.js`.  By pulling the URL, username and password from that file, `QueryInterface` can instantiate a Neo4j driver instance (the official JavaScript driver) and use it to execute arbitrary Cypher strings, returning the raw result objects to its callers.

Because the file hierarchy places `QueryInterface` alongside sibling modules such as **ConnectionPool** and **GraphDatabaseConfigurator**, it is clear that the designers intended a clean separation: configuration handling, connection pooling, and query execution each occupy their own module, while the **GraphDatabaseManager** composes them to present a higher‑level façade to the rest of the application.

## Architecture and Design  

The observable architecture follows a **modular, layered** approach.  The lowest layer is the **graph‑database‑config.js** file, which centralises all connection parameters.  Above that, **GraphDatabaseConfigurator** (implemented in `graph‑database‑configurator.ts`) reads those parameters and prepares the driver configuration object.  The **ConnectionPool** module then creates and manages a pool of driver sessions, leveraging Neo4j’s built‑in pooling capabilities.  `QueryInterface` sits on top of the pool, acting as a **gateway** that translates method calls into Cypher execution requests.

The pattern that emerges is essentially a **Facade** (GraphDatabaseManager) over a set of **Infrastructure** components (Configurator, ConnectionPool, QueryInterface).  `QueryInterface` itself can be seen as an **Adapter** to the Neo4j driver: it hides driver‑specific session handling and provides a stable, application‑specific method signature.  No other architectural patterns (e.g., event‑driven, micro‑services) are mentioned in the observations, so the design remains strictly intra‑process and synchronous.

Interaction flow is straightforward: when a consumer calls a method on **GraphDatabaseManager**, the manager delegates the call to `QueryInterface`.  `QueryInterface` obtains a session from **ConnectionPool**, runs the supplied Cypher via the driver, and returns the result.  All modules share the same configuration source, guaranteeing consistent connection settings across the stack.

## Implementation Details  

* **Configuration (`graph-database-config.js`)** – This JavaScript file exports a plain object (or environment‑derived values) containing `url`, `username`, and `password`.  It is the single source of truth for connection credentials, allowing developers to change the target database without touching any query logic.

* **Configurator (`graph-database-configurator.ts`)** – Although the exact code is not shown, the observations indicate that this TypeScript module imports the config file and builds the driver options object expected by the Neo4j driver.  It likely exports a function such as `createDriverConfig()` that returns `{ uri, auth }`.

* **ConnectionPool** – Implemented with Neo4j’s driver, this module creates a driver instance (`neo4j.driver(uri, auth, { maxConnectionPoolSize, ... })`) and exposes methods like `acquireSession()` and `releaseSession()`.  By centralising session lifecycle, it prevents resource leaks and enables reuse of underlying TCP connections.

* **QueryInterface (`query‑interface.ts`)** – The core of the module imports the driver (or the pool) and defines functions such as `runQuery(cypher: string, params?: object): Promise<Result>` .  Internally it:
  1. Calls the pool to obtain a session.
  2. Executes `session.run(cypher, params)`.
  3. Awaits the result, optionally mapping Neo4j records to plain JavaScript objects.
  4. Closes or releases the session back to the pool.
  Because the file is TypeScript, the API is strongly typed, which helps callers (including **GraphDatabaseManager**) to handle results safely.

* **GraphDatabaseManager** – This higher‑level component composes `QueryInterface` (and possibly other helpers) to expose domain‑specific operations (e.g., `findUserById`, `createRelationship`).  It does not manage connections directly; instead it relies on `QueryInterface` for all data access, reinforcing the single‑responsibility principle.

## Integration Points  

`QueryInterface` is tightly coupled to three other parts of the system:

1. **Configuration** – It imports `graph‑database‑config.js` (directly or indirectly via the configurator) to obtain connection credentials.  Any change in the config file propagates automatically to the query layer.

2. **ConnectionPool** – The interface depends on the pool for session acquisition.  The pool abstracts the Neo4j driver’s pooling logic, so `QueryInterface` never creates a driver itself; it merely asks for a ready‑to‑use session.

3. **GraphDatabaseManager** – This is the sole consumer of `QueryInterface`.  The manager’s public methods are thin wrappers that forward the actual Cypher to the interface, meaning that any new query added to the system will typically involve adding a method to the manager and a corresponding Cypher string passed through `QueryInterface`.

External modules that need to run ad‑hoc queries could also import `QueryInterface` directly, but the design encourages going through **GraphDatabaseManager** to keep business logic centralized.

## Usage Guidelines  

* **Never instantiate a Neo4j driver inside `QueryInterface`** – rely on the shared `ConnectionPool` to provide sessions.  This prevents duplicate connection pools and conserves resources.

* **Always pass parameters as a separate object** rather than interpolating values into the Cypher string.  This leverages Neo4j’s parameter binding, avoids injection risks, and lets the driver cache query plans.

* **Handle promises correctly** – `runQuery` returns a `Promise<Result>`.  Callers should `await` the result or attach `.then/.catch` handlers, and ensure any errors are propagated to the higher‑level manager for consistent error handling.

* **Keep queries read‑only when possible** in performance‑critical paths.  If a query only reads data, use a read‑only session (`session = driver.session({ defaultAccessMode: neo4j.session.READ })`) – the pool may expose a helper for this.

* **Do not modify the configuration object at runtime**.  The `graph‑database‑config.js` file is intended to be immutable after the application starts; any dynamic changes should be made through environment variables and a restart.

* **When adding new domain operations**, extend **GraphDatabaseManager** rather than calling `QueryInterface` directly.  This preserves the façade and keeps business rules in one place.

### Architectural patterns identified  

1. **Facade** – `GraphDatabaseManager` presents a simplified API to the rest of the system.  
2. **Adapter** – `QueryInterface` adapts the Neo4j driver’s session API to a domain‑specific method signature.  
3. **Singleton‑like configuration** – `graph‑database‑config.js` acts as a single source of truth for connection settings.  
4. **Connection Pooling** – Implemented by the **ConnectionPool** module, leveraging Neo4j driver’s built‑in pooling.

### Design decisions and trade‑offs  

* **Separation of concerns** – By splitting configuration, pooling, and query execution, the codebase gains clarity and testability.  The trade‑off is a modest increase in the number of modules to maintain.  
* **Synchronous query façade** – `QueryInterface` returns promises, keeping the API asynchronous yet straightforward.  This avoids the complexity of event‑driven or reactive streams but may limit fine‑grained back‑pressure control.  
* **Centralised configuration** – Simplifies deployment but couples all database connections to a single set of credentials; rotating credentials requires a restart.

### System structure insights  

The system is organised as a narrow vertical stack: a low‑level configuration file → a configurator → a connection pool → a query interface → a manager.  Each layer depends only on the layer directly beneath it, creating a clear dependency chain.  Sibling modules (`ConnectionPool`, `GraphDatabaseConfigurator`) share the same configuration source, ensuring consistency across the stack.

### Scalability considerations  

* **Connection pooling** already provides horizontal scalability for concurrent request handling; the pool size can be tuned in the driver options.  
* Because `QueryInterface` executes raw Cypher strings, scaling the read/write workload largely depends on the underlying Neo4j cluster’s capacity rather than the application code.  
* Adding caching (e.g., result caching) would need to be introduced above `QueryInterface`—perhaps inside **GraphDatabaseManager**—to avoid altering the low‑level query path.

### Maintainability assessment  

The modular layout makes the codebase highly maintainable: changes to connection parameters are isolated to `graph‑database‑config.js`; adjustments to pooling behavior stay within **ConnectionPool**; and any evolution of query execution (e.g., adding logging or metrics) can be done inside `QueryInterface` without touching business logic.  TypeScript typings further reduce runtime errors.  The main maintenance risk is the proliferation of raw Cypher strings; adopting a query‑builder library or centralising query definitions could mitigate that, but such a change would need to be introduced deliberately rather than assumed.


## Hierarchy Context

### Parent
- [GraphDatabaseManager](./GraphDatabaseManager.md) -- GraphDatabaseManager uses a graph database library, such as Neo4j, to interact with the graph database, as defined in the graph-database-config.js file

### Siblings
- [ConnectionPool](./ConnectionPool.md) -- The ConnectionPool module is likely implemented using a library like Neo4j's official JavaScript driver, which provides a connection pooling mechanism.
- [GraphDatabaseConfigurator](./GraphDatabaseConfigurator.md) -- The GraphDatabaseConfigurator module is likely defined in a separate file, such as graph-database-configurator.ts, which imports the graph-database-config.js file and configures the connection settings.
