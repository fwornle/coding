# Measurement Architecture

## Overview

This page explains how a single experiment is measured end-to-end — from a plain-English description to a ranked comparison the dashboard reads live. The pipeline is a **thin skill wrapper** over two CLIs (`experiment-run.mjs`, `experiments-compare.mjs`); all the measurement logic lives in `lib/experiments/` and is shared by both the CLI and the dashboard API so the two can never drift.

## The measurement span

Each run is wrapped in a **measurement span** keyed by a `task_id`:

- **`measurement-start.mjs`** opens the span and writes `.data/active-measurement.json`. On top of that span, every cell also binds its tokens **per-request** so capture is robust even when the cell isn't the only thing routing through the proxy (Phase 84):
    - **claude** carries an `x-task-id` header on each call;
    - **opencode** splices an `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` provider config that binds *both* of its wires — the anthropic provider via `/v1` + `x-task-id`, the openai/copilot providers via a task-scoped `/v1/opencode/t/<taskId>` base-URL path;
    - **mastra** routes via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`; **copilot** uses the BYOK task-scoped seam.
  The shared `rapid-llm-proxy` (port **12435**) stamps every `token_usage` row with that `task_id`; the ambient `active-measurement.json` span is the *fallback* for any call that doesn't carry its own binding. Wire rows are the **primary** token source for all agents — the `cladpt`/`copadt` transcript adapters no longer capture here; at close they run in **reconcile** mode (verify wire rows, fill gaps: reasoning tokens, cache split).
- The agent then drives the goal inside a restored **sandbox** snapshot (`snapshot_id`, default `smoke-spec`) so runs are reproducible and isolated.
- **`measurement-stop.mjs`** closes the span: it aggregates tokens from `token-usage.db WHERE task_id = ?`, runs the **evidence harness** (the objective `test_command` gate), invokes the **Haiku judge** for the 5-dimension rubric, and persists the results.

### Roles, foreground/background, and the ambient panel

A run's tokens are classified into three **role lanes** — **foreground development**, **knowledge capture**, and **infrastructure** — so a reader sees not just *how much* a run cost but *what kind* of work it did. `token-aggregate.mjs` separates the measured **foreground** session from concurrent **background** daemons (`consolidator-*`, `health-coordinator`, `observation-writer`, …): a daemon denylist **overrides** the adapter hash, so an `observation-writer` row carrying `cladpt` still classifies as background and never inflates the run's cost. The dominant foreground group becomes the run's `canonical_agent` / `canonical_model`. (This classifier is agent-agnostic — it keys on the process/role, not on a hardcoded per-agent hash.)

**Agent-agnostic lane totals.** Only agents that task-stamp their background work (opencode tags ~100%; claude/copilot/mastra barely tag) would otherwise show `0/0` Knowledge and Infrastructure lanes. To make the lanes meaningful for *every* agent, the run timeline folds **time-window-matched ambient rows** into the role lanes. Those rows are concurrent background traffic that ran during the run's window but is **not** attributed to it (empty/foreign `task_id`); the backend already excludes the run's own `task_id`, so the fold is additive, never double-counted. Sandboxed experiment cells are left untouched — no foreign window-join into a throwaway worktree.

**The Ambient activity panel.** Below each run's timeline, a collapsible **"Concurrent background activity"** panel honestly surfaces those in-window, unattributed processes (per process: role, calls, tokens, models). It is never a causation claim — just "this was happening at the same time" — and it makes the knowledge-capture + infrastructure spend that the task-exact stats deliberately exclude *visible* instead of hidden.

## Always-on per-agent measurement

Historically, a real context-window breakdown required someone to click **Start measurement** first — an interactive session that never opened a span routed through the proxy with an empty `task_id`, so the dashboard could only show an *illustrative* context band. The **measurement reconciler** removes that manual step: it keeps a live measurement span bound for each foreground agent session automatically, so **claude / opencode / copilot** sessions get a real, proportional context-window breakdown with zero manual action.

!!! warning "Capture requires proxy-routed traffic"
    The per-category context-window breakdown is produced **only** by the proxy wire-tap at `localhost:12435`, which parses the actual request buffer. A session gets a real band only if its traffic **flows through the proxy** — i.e. it uses the `rapid-proxy` provider (`http://localhost:12435/v1`). Sessions on a provider that talks to the upstream API directly (e.g. opencode's built-in **`github-copilot/*`** models, or Claude Code before its `/v1/messages` calls are routed through the proxy) **bypass the tap**: the reconciler still binds a slot and token *totals* are backfilled by the `token-adapter-*` reconcilers, but there is no wire buffer to split, so the dashboard correctly falls back to the *illustrative* band. To capture an opencode session, point it at a `rapid-proxy/<model>` model rather than `github-copilot/<model>`.

![Always-on per-agent measurement — reconciler binds each live session](../images/measurement-auto-reconciler.png)

**How it works.** A standalone, launchd-supervised loop (`scripts/measurement-reconciler.mjs`, `com.coding.measurement-reconciler`) ticks every `pollMs` (default **5s**):

1. **Detect** each agent's live foreground session (`lib/measurement/foreground-sessions.mjs`) — claude via the newest `*.jsonl` transcript mtime, opencode via the most-recent top-level session in its SQLite store, copilot via the newest `events.jsonl` mtime. Locations come from `getAgentSearchPaths()`, the single source of truth. (**mastra** is stubbed — it returns `null` pending removal.)
2. **Bind** a fresh session (activity within `freshnessMs`, default **120s**) by writing a **per-agent** span slot `.data/active-measurement.<agent>.json` with `task_id = session_id` — the same key the wire-tap Run reconstruction uses, so proxy traffic and the reconstructed Run correlate.
3. **Clear** its own slot when a session goes stale, or rebind when the session rotates.

**Isolation (D-08 preserved).** The proxy binds the header-less interactive `/v1/messages` tap to the **per-agent** slot *only* (`resolveAgentSpanTaskId`) — it never inherits the global `active-measurement.json` span. So a concurrent experiment or a manual measurement can never leak into an ambient interactive session, and vice versa. The global manual/experiment slot and any operator-pinned per-agent slot are left untouched by the reconciler.

**Control (`config/behavior.json` → `autoMeasure`).** A single global checkbox in the dashboard's **Measurement** card toggles always-on binding; the reconciler hot-reloads the config each tick. When always-on is **enabled**, the manual Start form is replaced by a **Reset** button — Reset clears the reconciler-owned per-agent slots (`POST /api/experiments/measurement/reset`) so each live session rebinds fresh on the next tick.

| Always-on **enabled** | Always-on **disabled** |
|---|---|
| ![Auto measurement on — Reset control](../images/measurement-auto-control.png) | ![Manual Start form](../images/measurement-manual-control.png) |

**Endpoints:** `GET/POST /api/experiments/measurement/behavior` (read/merge `autoMeasure`) · `POST /api/experiments/measurement/reset` (clear-and-rebind).

## The data model

Three linked entities are written to the dedicated experiment store (`.data/experiments/leveldb`, kept separate from the knowledge graph to avoid churn):

| Entity | Key fields | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Run** | `task_id`, `task_hash`, `task_class`, `agent`/`model`/`framework`/`env`, `variant`, `repeat`, `terminal_state`, 6 route heuristics | one execution of the goal by one variant |
| **Score** | `gate_passed` (true/false/null), 5-dim rubric (`goal_achieved`, `code_quality`, `test_coverage`, `regressions`, `spec_drift`), `goal_aligned_ratio` | objective gate + quality signal |
| **Outcome** | `totalTokens`, `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `reasoningTokens` | the cost totals |

Key discipline — **null is not zero (D-09):** a metric that could not be computed is stored `null` and *excluded* from stats, never coerced to `0`. This keeps means honest and prevents a missing rubric from dividing the composite by zero (such a variant routes to **unscored** instead).

### `task_hash` closes the loop

The runner derives `task_hash = sha256(goal_sentence)` at close. The `/experiment` skill re-derives the *same* hash (it owns the goal sentence) and passes it straight to the compare step — so `run → compare → dashboard` is mechanically closed with no stdout scraping.

## Comparison & the dashboard

`experiments-compare.mjs` calls `buildComparison(rows, {taskHash, rankBy})` from `lib/experiments/compare.mjs`:

1. **read** all runs for the `task_hash` (join Run → Score → Outcome),
2. **classify** each variant into the honesty-spine group (ranked/failed/ungated/unscored),
3. **aggregate** each ranked variant's successful runs into `{mean, stddev, median, min, max, n}`,
4. **rank** by `--rank-by` (`composite` default, or `tokens` / `wallclock` / `score`),
5. **write** `.data/experiments/reports/<task_hash>.json`.

That exact JSON is what the dashboard's **Comparison** tab reads via `GET /api/experiments/comparison` — and the endpoint calls the *same* `buildComparison`, guarded by a deep-equality test, so the CLI table and the dashboard can never disagree.

**Service ports involved:** dashboard `:3032` · dashboard API `:3033` · vkb `:8080` · llm-proxy `:12435`. The proxy, obs-api, and ETM run as auto-respawning launchd daemons (`com.coding.*`).
