    **In-Memory Graph**
    • Fast graph operations
    • Multi-graph support
    • Rich algorithms
    • Event-driven updates
  end note

  note bottom of level
    **Persistent Storage**
    • Key-value storage
    • Atomic operations
    • File-based
    • .data/knowledge-graph/
  end note

  note bottom of json
    **Git-Tracked Exports**
    • Auto-export on changes (5s)
    • Auto-import on startup
    • Team collaboration via git

note right of services
  **Service Architecture**

  GraphDatabaseService:
  • Primary graph interface
  • Event emitter (entity:stored, etc.)
  • Team-scoped operations

  GraphKnowledgeExporter:
  • Auto-export (default: true)
  • Debounced (5s after changes)
  • Event-driven triggers

  GraphKnowledgeImporter:
  • Auto-import on startup
  • Newest-wins conflict resolution
  • Team isolation
