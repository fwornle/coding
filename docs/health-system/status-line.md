# Status Line System

Real-time visual indicators of system health and development activity, rendered in the **tmux status bar** for all coding agents (Claude Code, CoPilot, and future agents).

## Tmux-Based Rendering

All agents are wrapped in tmux sessions via the shared `scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh`. The status line is rendered using tmux's `status-right` directive, which invokes `scripts/status-line-fast.cjs` every 5 seconds. This CJS (CommonJS) fast-path reads a pre-rendered cache file in ~60ms, eliminating the 2-18 second ESM module loading penalty that occurs under system load. When the cache is stale, it triggers a background refresh via `combined-status-line.js`.

**Key benefits:**
- Unified rendering across all agents (no agent-specific status line code)
- Full support for tmux formatting codes (underline, bold, colors)
- Consistent status bar positioning at the bottom of the terminal
- Mouse support forwarded to the agent running inside tmux
- Ultra-fast cache-based rendering (~60ms) — never blanks under load

## What It Shows

The Status Line provides a **compact, real-time view** of all system activity across multiple coding agent sessions.

**Icons**: ✅ healthy, 🟡 warning (with reason), 🔴 unhealthy (with reason), ❓ unknown

### API Quota Monitoring

The status line displays **live spending data** for all LLM providers using automatic API-based tracking.

**Format**: `[Provider$X ...]`

**Provider Abbreviations and Data Sources**:

| Abbrev | Provider | Data Source | Env Vars Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `Gq` | Groq | BudgetTracker + centralized usage reporters (`.data/llm-usage-costs.json`) | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| `Ggl` | Google Gemini | Free tier (no tracking needed) | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `A` | Anthropic | Admin API (`/v1/organizations/cost_report`) | `ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_API_KEY` |
| `O` | OpenAI | Admin API (`/v1/organization/costs`) | `OPENAI_ADMIN_API_KEY` |
| `X` | X.AI Grok | Management API (`prepaid/balance`) | `XAI_MANAGEMENT_KEY` + `XAI_TEAM_ID` |

**Display Logic**:

| Scenario | Display | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Admin API: spend data | `A$2` | $2 spent this month (live from API) |
| Admin API: with prepaid credits | `A$18` | $18 remaining of prepaid amount |
| Monthly billing (Groq) | `Gq$0FEB` | $0 spent in February (auto-tracked) |
| Management API (xAI) | `X$25` | $25 remaining prepaid balance |
| Free tier (Google) | `Ggl●` | Available (rate-limited only) |
| No admin key configured | `O○` | Cannot get usage data |

**Pie Chart Symbols** (used when percentage-based display applies):
- `●` (full) - Fully available / >87.5% remaining
- `◕` (¾) - 62.5-87.5% remaining
- `◐` (½) - 37.5-62.5% remaining
- `◔` (¼) - 12.5-37.5% remaining
- `○` (empty) - <12.5% remaining or no data

**Examples**:
- `[Gq$0FEB A$0 O$0 X$25]` - All providers live: Groq $0 in Feb, Anthropic $0 spent, OpenAI $0 spent, xAI $25 remaining
- `[Gq$1FEB A$5 O$3 X$20]` - Active usage across all providers
- `[A◐ O◔]` - Percentage mode (when prepaid credits configured)

**Setup**:

Run the interactive setup script to configure admin/management API keys:

```bash
node scripts/setup-api-keys.js
```

This validates each key with a test API call before saving to `.env`. Groq requires no setup (automatic centralized tracking).

**Configuration**:

Provider credits in `config/live-logging-config.json` are used as fallbacks or for prepaid balance display:

```json
"provider_credits": {
  "groq": {
    "billingType": "monthly",
    "billingMonth": "MAR",
    "spendLimit": null,
    "externalSpend": 13.32,
    "autoScrape": true,
    "scrapeIntervalMinutes": 60
  },
  "anthropic": { "prepaidCredits": 0 },
  "openai": { "prepaidCredits": null },
  "xai": { "prepaidCredits": 25 }
}
```

**Groq Cost Tracking (Centralized)**:

Groq has no billing API. Spend is tracked through three complementary mechanisms:

1. **BudgetTracker** (`src/inference/BudgetTracker.js`) — Tracks per-provider costs from LLM calls made through the main inference pipeline. Writes to `.data/llm-usage-costs.json` (debounced, atomic).

2. **Centralized Usage Reporters** — External consumers of the Groq API key report their usage via shared reporter modules:
   - `lib/utils/usage-cost-reporter.js` (Node.js) — Used by `mcp-constraint-monitor`
   - `integrations/code-graph-rag/codebase_rag/utils/usage_cost_reporter.py` (Python) — Used by `code-graph-rag`
   - Both use file locking and write to the same `.data/llm-usage-costs.json` file

3. **externalSpend offset** — A manual offset in `config/live-logging-config.json` that covers usage from consumers not yet integrated with centralized reporting (e.g., `okb/rapid-automations`, Docker containers). This value is added to the tracked local spend.

4. **Stagehand billing scraper** (`scripts/groq-billing-scraper.js`) — Periodic ground-truth validation against the Groq billing dashboard using AI-powered page extraction. Runs hourly when `autoScrape` is enabled; invoked as a background process by `statusline-health-monitor.js`.

The `api-quota-checker.js` computes total Groq spend as: `localSpend` (from `.data/llm-usage-costs.json`) + `externalSpend` (config offset). The `externalSpend` resets to 0 on month rollover.

**API Keys / Management Keys** (in `.env`):

| Variable | Provider | Where to Get It |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_API_KEY` | Anthropic | console.anthropic.com → Settings → Admin API Keys |
| `OPENAI_ADMIN_API_KEY` | OpenAI | platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys |
| `XAI_MANAGEMENT_KEY` | xAI | console.x.ai → Settings → Management Keys |
| `XAI_TEAM_ID` | xAI | console.x.ai team settings URL |
| _(none needed)_ | Groq | Automatic via BudgetTracker + centralized reporters |

**Environment Loading**: The `status-line-fast.cjs` cache reader automatically loads `.env` from the repo root, so admin keys defined there are available to all status line processes without needing to export them in the shell.

### Docker Mode Indicator

When running in Docker mode, the status line displays additional indicators for containerized services.

**Docker Mode Detection:**
Docker mode is detected when:
- The `.docker-mode` marker file exists in the coding repository
- OR the `CODING_DOCKER_MODE=true` environment variable is set

**Docker MCP Health Display** (`[🐳MCP:...]`):

| Abbreviation | Service | Port | Health Check |
|--------------|---------|------|--------------|
| `SA` | Semantic Analysis | 3848 | `http://localhost:3848/health` |
| `CM` | Constraint Monitor | 3849 | `http://localhost:3849/health` |
| `CGR` | Code Graph RAG | 3850 | `http://localhost:3850/health` |

**Status Icons:**
- `✅` - Service healthy and responding
- `❌` - Service down or not responding
- `⚠️` - Service responding but with issues

**Examples:**
- `[🐳MCP:SA✅CM✅CGR✅]` - All Docker MCP services healthy
- `[🐳MCP:SA✅CM❌CGR✅]` - Constraint Monitor is down
- `[🐳MCP:SA⚠️CM✅CGR✅]` - Semantic Analysis has issues

**Note:** Browser Access (port 3847) is not shown in the abbreviated display but is monitored as part of the internal health system.

### Unified Health Status Indicator

The `[🏥...]` section shows **unified system health** combining:
- **GCM (Global Coding Monitor)**: Session coordinator health
- **Health Verifier**: Service, database, and process health
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Whether constraints are actively enforced

| Display | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `[🏥✅]` | All systems healthy | None needed |
| `[🏥⚠️]` | Issues detected | Check dashboard for details |
| `[🏥⏰]` | **Stale** - verification data >2 minutes old | Health verifier may have crashed |
| `[🏥❌]` | Critical issues or error | Immediate attention required |
| `[🏥💤]` | Health verifier offline | Start health verifier |

**Note**: Violation counts are no longer shown in the status line. Details are available on the health dashboard at http://localhost:3033.

**Common Causes of `[🏥⚠️]` (Issues)**:
- Constraint enforcement disabled
- Service health check failures
- Database connectivity issues
- Stale PIDs in process registry

**To Fix Issues**:
```bash
# Check health details
node scripts/health-verifier.js status

# Manually trigger verification with auto-heal
node scripts/health-verifier.js --auto-heal

# Or restart all services
coding --restart-services
```

The health verifier runs every 60 seconds with auto-healing enabled.

### Transcript Discovery Auto-Heal

The statusline-health-monitor detects **broken transcript monitors** — monitors that are running but cannot find their project's Claude JSONL transcript file (e.g., due to path encoding mismatches).

**Detection**: If a monitor has been running >2 minutes with `transcriptPath: null`, the health monitor identifies it as a broken state.

**Remediation**: The broken monitor is killed via `SIGTERM`. The Global Process Supervisor automatically restarts it, picking up any fixes to the transcript discovery logic.

**Status Line**: Affected sessions show `🟡` (warning) with "Transcript discovery failed — restarting monitor" instead of silently disappearing.

**Path Encoding**: Claude Code encodes project paths by replacing both `/` and `_` with `-`. For example, `/Users/foo/Agentic/_work/my-project` becomes `-Users-foo-Agentic--work-my-project`. The transcript monitor's `getProjectDirName()` must match this encoding exactly.

### Trajectory States

- `🔍 EX` (Exploring) - Information gathering and analysis
- `📈 ON` (On Track) - Productive progression
- `📉 OFF` (Off Track) - Deviating from optimal path
- `⚙️ IMP` (Implementing) - Active code modification
- `✅ VER` (Verifying) - Testing and validation
- `🚫 BLK` (Blocked) - Intervention preventing action

### LSL Status Indicators

**Color Coding**:
- 🟢 Green - Session window open (>1 hour remaining)
- 🟠 Orange - Window closing soon (<1 hour)
- 🔴 Red - Window closed or expired

**Format**: `🟢HHMM-HHMM(Xmin)` where:
- `HHMM-HHMM` - Session time window
- `(Xmin)` - Minutes since last activity
- `→project` - Project with activity

### Session Activity Indicators

Session activity uses a **unified graduated color scheme** that transitions smoothly from active to dormant. **All sessions are always displayed** - sleeping sessions show as 💤, never hidden.

| Icon | Status | Time Since Activity | Description |
|------|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| 🟢 | Active | < 5 minutes | Active session with recent activity |
| 🌲 | Cooling | 5 - 15 minutes | Session cooling down |
| 🫒 | Fading | 15 min - 1 hour | Session fading, still tracked |
| 🪨 | Dormant | 1 - 6 hours | Session dormant but alive |
| ⚫ | Inactive | 6 - 24 hours | Session inactive but tracked |
| 💤 | Sleeping | > 24 hours | Long-term dormant session |
| ❌ | Error | Any | Health check failed or service crash |

**Session Lifecycle**:
```
🟢 Active → 🌲 Cooling → 🫒 Fading → 🪨 Dormant → ⚫ Inactive → 💤 Sleeping
   <5min      5-15min     15m-1hr     1-6hr        6-24hr       >24hr
```

**Sessions are only removed** when the agent process has exited (session closed). A session with a running agent always shows as 🟢 Active, regardless of transcript age.

**No Yellow Status**: The system intentionally avoids yellow (🟡) for session inactivity. Yellow is reserved for actual warnings like missing trajectory files or stale health data. Normal session inactivity is shown through the graduated cooling sequence.

**Agent Age Cap**: When an agent process (claude, copilot, opencode) is running, the displayed age is capped at the transcript monitor's uptime. This prevents a freshly started session in a project with old transcripts from immediately showing as dormant. The session starts as 🟢 and naturally progresses through the cooling scheme based on how long the current session has been idle.

**Not-Found Transcript Guard**: Agents that don't produce Claude-compatible transcripts (e.g., OpenCode) have `transcriptInfo.status: 'not_found'` with `ageMs: 0`. The age cap logic skips these sessions — they correctly display as ⚫ inactive instead of falsely showing as 🟢 active.

**Activity Age Calculation**:
- Uses `transcriptInfo.ageMs` from health file (actual transcript inactivity)
- Falls back to health file timestamp if transcript age unavailable
- For stale health files (>5 min old), uses health file age as minimum to ensure closed sessions aren't falsely shown as active
- Capped at monitor uptime when agent is running (prevents stale transcript age from showing dormant on fresh sessions)

**Design Rationale**: Projects that aren't actively being worked on should show gradual "cooling" colors rather than alarming red/orange/yellow. These colors are reserved for actual errors and warnings, not normal session lifecycle states.

## Architecture

The Status Line is part of the **6-Layer Health System** with 9 core classes:

![Health System Classes](../images/health-system-classes.png)

The StatusLineHealthMonitor (Layer 4) aggregates health from all other layers and outputs to the Combined Status Line display.

![StatusLine Architecture](../images/statusline-architecture.png)

### Core Components

**1. Status Line Fast-Path** (`scripts/status-line-fast.cjs`)
- Ultra-fast CommonJS cache reader (~60ms) — invoked by tmux `status-right` every 5 seconds
- Reads pre-rendered status from `.logs/combined-status-line-cache.txt`
- If cache <60s old: serves immediately (no Node.js ESM overhead)
- If cache >20s old: triggers background refresh via `combined-status-line.js` (detached)
- Falls back to synchronous full CSL only if cache missing or >60s stale
- Solves the 2-18 second ESM module resolution penalty under high system load

**2. Combined Status Line** (`scripts/combined-status-line.js`)
- Full status display with all segments (health, quota, sessions, compliance, knowledge, LSL)
- Writes cache to `.logs/combined-status-line-cache.txt` after successful generation
- **GPS heartbeat gate**: ensure* supervision functions only run when GPS heartbeat is stale (>60s)
- When GPS is running (normal): display-only, no process spawning
- When GPS is dead: fallback supervisor for GPS, SHM, and transcript monitors
- Smart abbreviations for compact display

**3. Status Line Integration**

![Status Line Integration](../images/status-line-trajectory-integration.png)

**Data Sources**:
- **Health System**: Provides system health scores from `.health/verification-status.json`
- **Constraint Monitor**: Provides compliance percentage from constraint API
- **Trajectory Analyzer**: Provides current development state from `.specstory/trajectory/live-state.json`
- **API Quota Checker**: Provides LLM provider usage from `lib/api-quota-checker.js`
- **LSL System**: Provides logging status from Global LSL Registry

### Session Discovery

The system uses multiple discovery methods to find all active sessions:

**Discovery Methods**:
1. **Running Monitor Detection**: Checks `ps aux` for running `enhanced-transcript-monitor.js` processes
2. **Agent Process Detection**: Scans for `claude`, `copilot`, and `opencode` processes via `ps -eo pid,comm` and resolves project from working directory via `lsof`
3. **Registry-based Discovery**: Uses Global LSL Registry for registered sessions
4. **Dynamic Discovery**: Scans Claude transcript directories for unregistered sessions
5. **Health File Validation**: Uses centralized health files from `.health/` directory

**Key Behavior**:
- Sessions with a **running agent process** use age capped at monitor uptime (graduated cooling from session start)
- Sessions with running transcript monitors but no active agent use graduated activity icons
- Sessions WITHOUT running monitors BUT with a running agent are shown as 💤 (no monitor yet)
- Sessions are **only removed** when the agent process has exited — never hidden
- The Global Process Supervisor automatically restarts dead monitors within 30 seconds

**Multi-Agent Support**:
- **Claude**: Detected via `ps -eo pid,comm` with exact match on `claude`
- **Copilot**: Detected via path-ending match `/copilot$` (comm shows full binary path)
- **OpenCode**: Detected via path-ending match `/opencode$` (comm shows full binary path)
- New agents can be added to the detection loop in `getRunningAgentSessions()`

**Example**:
- `[C🟢 UT🟢]` - coding and ui-template both active
- `[C🟢 CA🌲]` - coding active, curriculum-alignment cooling
- `[C🟢 UT🫒 CA🪨]` - coding active, ui-template fading, curriculum-alignment dormant
- Sessions only removed when agent process exits (never hidden while running)

### Smart Abbreviation Engine

Project names are automatically abbreviated using intelligent algorithms:

**Examples**:
- **coding** → **C**
- **curriculum-alignment** → **CA**
- **nano-degree** → **ND**
- **project-management** → **PM**
- **user-interface** → **UI**

**Algorithm Handles**:
- Single words: First letter (coding → C)
- Hyphenated words: First letter of each part (curriculum-alignment → CA)
- Camel case: Capital letters (projectManagement → PM)
- Multiple separators: Intelligent parsing

## Multi-Session Support

The status line displays information for **multiple active coding agent sessions** simultaneously. Only sessions active within the last 24 hours are shown.

### Session Display

**Single Active Session**:
```
[🏥✅] [Gq$0FEB A$0 O$0 X$25] [C🟢] [🔒 67% 🔍EX] [📚✅] 📋17-18
```

**Multiple Active Sessions**:
```
[🏥⚠️] [Gq$0FEB A$0 O$0 X$25] [C🟢 UT🫒 CA🌲] [🔒 67% 🔍EX] [📚✅] 📋17-18
```

Where:
- `C` - coding project (active)
- `UT` - ui-template project (fading)
- `CA` - curriculum-alignment project (cooling)
- Current project is underlined in terminal

### Session Prioritization

**Activity-Based Priority**:
1. Most recently active project shown first
2. `→` indicator points to active project
3. Dormant sessions shown with abbreviated status

## How It Works

### Status Line Update Flow

![Status Line Hook Timing](../images/status-line-hook-timing.png)

**Cache Fast-Path (normal operation)**:
1. **Tmux fires** `status-line-fast.cjs` every 5 seconds
2. **Cache check**: Read `.logs/combined-status-line-cache.txt`
3. If cache <60s old → **serve immediately** (~60ms, no further processing)
4. If cache >20s old → trigger **background refresh** (detached `combined-status-line.js`)
5. If cache missing/stale → synchronous fallback to full CSL

**Full Refresh (background or fallback)**:
1. **Status Collection**:
   - Read health verification status
   - Query constraint monitor API
   - Read trajectory state file
   - Check API quota for all providers
   - Scan LSL registry
2. **Status Aggregation**: Combine all indicators
3. **Display**: Output full status bar
4. **Cache Write**: Save to `.logs/combined-status-line-cache.txt`
5. **GPS Heartbeat Check**: If GPS heartbeat >60s stale, run ensure* functions as fallback supervisor

### Update Frequency

**Triggered By**:
- Tmux `status-right` every 5 seconds (via fast-path cache)
- Background refresh when cache >20s old
- Full CSL fallback when cache missing

**Caching**:
- Pre-rendered status cache (fast-path): 60s TTL, 20s background refresh trigger
- Health status cached for 5 minutes
- Constraint compliance cached for 1 minute
- API quota cached for 30 seconds (real-time) or 5 minutes (estimated)
- Trajectory state read on every update
- LSL status read on every update

### Integration Points

**File Locations**:
- Health: `.health/verification-status.json`
- Trajectory: `.specstory/trajectory/live-state.json`
- API Quota: `lib/api-quota-checker.js` (shared library)
- LSL Registry: `.lsl/global-registry.json`
- Constraint API: `http://localhost:3031/api/compliance/:project`

## State Diagrams

### Service Lifecycle States

![Service Lifecycle State](../images/service-lifecycle-state.png)

**Unified Health States** (for `[🏥...]` indicator):
- **Healthy** (✅) - All systems operational (GCM + Health Verifier + Enforcement)
- **Warning** (⚠️) - Issues detected - check dashboard for details
- **Stale** (⏰) - Health data older than 2 minutes
- **Critical** (❌) - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **Offline** (💤) - Health verifier not running

**Session Activity States** (for project sessions - graduated cooling scheme):
- **Active** (🟢) - Currently active (< 5 min)
- **Cooling** (🌲) - Recently active (5-15 min)
- **Fading** (🫒) - Activity fading (15 min - 1 hr)
- **Dormant** (🪨) - Dormant but trackable (1-6 hr)
- **Inactive** (⚫) - Session idle (6-24 hr) - last visible state
- **Sleeping** (💤) - Long-term dormant (> 24 hr) - still shown

**Transitions**:
- Health check success → Healthy (✅)
- GCM or Health Verifier issues → Warning (⚠️)
- Critical failures → Critical (❌)
- Time passage → 🟢 → 🌲 → 🫒 → 🪨 → ⚫ → 💤
- Sessions only removed when agent exits, never hidden while running

### Status Display States

**Color Transitions**:
- Green → Orange: 1 hour until session window closes
- Orange → Red: Session window has closed
- Red → Green: New session window opened

## Configuration

### Status Line Configuration

**File**: `config/status-line-config.json`

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "update_interval_ms": 5000,
  "cache_duration_ms": 300000,
  "health_source": ".health/verification-status.json",
  "trajectory_source": ".specstory/trajectory/live-state.json",
  "lsl_registry": ".lsl/global-registry.json",
  "constraint_api": "http://localhost:3031/api/compliance/{project}",
  "abbreviation_style": "smart",
  "multi_session_display": true,
  "max_sessions_displayed": 5
}
```

**Configuration Options**:
- `enabled`: Toggle status line on/off
- `update_interval_ms`: How often to check for updates (default: 5000ms)
- `cache_duration_ms`: How long to cache health status (default: 5 minutes)
- `abbreviation_style`: `smart` | `first-letter` | `full-name`
- `multi_session_display`: Show multiple sessions or just active one
- `max_sessions_displayed`: Maximum sessions to show (default: 5)

## Usage

### Starting the Status Line

The status line is **automatically started** with the `coding` command. All agents are wrapped in tmux, and the tmux `status-right` is configured to run `combined-status-line.js`:

```bash
# Start any agent - tmux wrapping is automatic
coding              # Status line renders in tmux status bar
coding --claude     # Same tmux wrapping
coding --copilot    # Same tmux wrapping
```

The tmux wrapper (`scripts/tmux-session-wrapper.sh`) handles:
- Creating a tmux session named `coding-{agent}-{PID}`
- Configuring `status-right` to invoke `status-line-fast.cjs` (CJS fast-path cache reader)
- Nesting guard: if already in tmux, configures the current session instead
- Mouse forwarding for interactive agent use

### Manual Status Line Check

```bash
# Get current status line output (fast-path from cache)
node scripts/status-line-fast.cjs

# Force full refresh (bypasses cache)
node scripts/combined-status-line.js

# Example output:
# [🏥⚠️] [Gq$0FEB A$0 O$0 X$25] [C🟢 UT🫒] [🔒 67% 🔍EX] [📚✅] 📋17-18
```

### Troubleshooting

**Status bar completely blank?**
```bash
# Check if the cache file exists and is recent
ls -la .logs/combined-status-line-cache.txt

# Test the fast-path directly
time node scripts/status-line-fast.cjs

# If cache is stale/missing, force a full refresh
node scripts/combined-status-line.js

# Check for process spawn storm (should be <80 Node processes)
ps aux | grep node | wc -l

# If >100 processes, kill the coordinator and let GPS restart cleanly
ps aux | grep global-service-coordinator | grep -v grep
```

**Status line not updating?**
```bash
# Check if health verifier is running
ps aux | grep health-verifier

# Manually trigger health check
node scripts/health-verifier.js

# Check status files exist
ls -la .health/verification-status.json
ls -la .specstory/trajectory/live-state.json
```

**Wrong project showing as active?**
```bash
# Check LSL registry
cat .lsl/global-registry.json | jq '.'

# Verify activity timestamps
cat .lsl/global-registry.json | jq '.sessions[] | {project, last_activity}'
```

**Session not showing that should be?**
```bash
# Check if agent process is detected (claude, copilot, opencode)
ps -eo pid,comm | awk '/claude$|copilot$|opencode$/ {print}'

# Check if the agent's cwd resolves to the right project
lsof -p <PID> 2>/dev/null | grep cwd

# Check if transcript monitor is running for that project
ps aux | grep enhanced-transcript-monitor | grep PROJECT_NAME

# Sessions show if: agent process running OR transcript monitor running
```

**Closed session still showing?**

```bash
# This shouldn't happen with the new logic - only sessions with running monitors are shown
# If it does, restart the statusline-health-monitor daemon:
node scripts/statusline-health-monitor.js --daemon --auto-heal --force
```

**Session shows wrong activity age (e.g., showing 🟢 when inactive)?**

```bash
# Check the health file for that project
cat .health/PROJECT-transcript-monitor-health.json | jq '{transcriptAge: .transcriptInfo.ageMs, timestamp}'

# The transcriptAge should be used (actual transcript inactivity)
# If health file is stale (>5 min old), file age is used as minimum
```

**Abbreviations incorrect?**

```bash
# Test abbreviation engine
node scripts/combined-status-line.js --test-abbreviations

# Manual abbreviation override in config
# Edit config/status-line-config.json
```

**Docker MCP services showing unhealthy?**

```bash
# Check if Docker containers are running
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps

# Test individual health endpoints
curl http://localhost:3848/health  # Semantic Analysis
curl http://localhost:3849/health  # Constraint Monitor
curl http://localhost:3850/health  # Code Graph RAG

# Check container logs for errors
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs coding-services

# Restart Docker services if needed
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml restart
```

**Docker mode not detected?**

```bash
# Check for Docker mode marker
ls -la .docker-mode

# Or check environment variable
echo $CODING_DOCKER_MODE

# Enable Docker mode
touch .docker-mode
# OR
export CODING_DOCKER_MODE=true
```

## Terminal Title Broadcasting

The status line system now includes **automatic terminal title updates** that work even for idle sessions.

### How It Works

Every 15 seconds, the statusline-health-monitor broadcasts status to all Claude session terminals via ANSI escape codes:

```
Terminal Tab: "C🟢 | UT🫒 CA🌲"
              ↑          ↑
        Current     Other active sessions
        project     (sleeping sessions hidden)
```

This means you can see the current status of ALL sessions by looking at any terminal's tab or title bar, even if that session is idle.

### Benefits

- **Always visible status**: No need to type to update the status line
- **Cross-session awareness**: Each terminal shows status of all projects
- **Minimal overhead**: Only writes to TTYs when status changes

### Terminal Compatibility

Works with terminals that support ANSI OSC (Operating System Command) escape sequences when written directly to TTY:

| Terminal | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| iTerm2 | ✅ Works | Full OSC 0 support |
| Terminal.app | ✅ Works | Native macOS terminal |
| VS Code Terminal | ❌ Limited | Does not process OSC 0 from external TTY writes |
| tmux | ✅ Works | All agents now run inside tmux (primary rendering target) |

**VSCode Limitation**: VSCode's integrated terminal captures TTY output and does not interpret OSC escape sequences written directly to the TTY device from external processes. The status line within the terminal content still updates on activity.

### Troubleshooting Terminal Titles

**Titles not updating?**
```bash
# Check if statusline-health-monitor is running
ps aux | grep statusline-health-monitor

# Check logs for TTY detection
grep -i tty ~/.logs/statusline-health.log

# Verify Claude processes have TTYs
ps -eo pid,tty,comm | grep claude
```
