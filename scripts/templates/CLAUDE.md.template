# CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions

This file provides project-specific guidance to Claude Code.

## 🌐 Cross-Project Knowledge

**IMPORTANT**: Always consider the shared knowledge base from the central Claude repository which contains:
- Transferable patterns that work across projects
- Common workflows and best practices
- Solutions to previously encountered problems

The knowledge base location is determined by where you installed the Claude tools.
Use `vkb` to visualize available patterns or check the knowledge base directly.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

- Always start Claude Code with `claude-mcp` (not `claude code`)
- Run `ukb` to capture valuable insights for the shared knowledge base
- Check `.specstory/history/` for previous conversation context
- Reference patterns from the knowledge base when applicable
