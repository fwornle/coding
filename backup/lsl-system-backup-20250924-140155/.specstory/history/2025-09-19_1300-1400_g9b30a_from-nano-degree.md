## Key Activities

### Bash - 2025-09-19 11:04:36 UTC [13:04:36 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial State**: The conversation began with the user reporting multiple issues after the corporate content migration work was completed. They showed screenshots indicating problems with Session 10 accessibility and image display.

2. **User's First Major Feedback**: 
   - Session 10 link still appearing in public mode (leading to 404)
   - Images showing as links instead of embedded images in corporate content
   - Missing sidebar on CN-only pages
   - Session 10 should only appear in CN mode
   - Navigation links around Session 9/10 transition need fixing

3. **My Initial Fixes**:
   - Fixed image display by enhancing corporate content loader with base64 conversion
   - Fixed missing sidebar by refining content area selector
   - Added dynamic Session 10 navigation injection
   - Initially removed Session 10 link from Session 9 entirely

4. **Critical User Correction**: 
   - User interrupted to correct me: "this change is wrong - it must be conditional: in CN the Next link must be there, in the public space it must be hidden"
   - I then properly fixed this using conditional display with `<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-corporate-only` class

5. **Technical Implementation Details**:
   - Fixed markdown-to-HTML conversion by processing images before links (regex order issue)
   - Enhanced image path normalization to handle both corporate-only and shared images
   - Corporate images converted to base64 data URLs from encrypted content
   - Shared images use adjusted web paths

6. **Final User Request** (Most Recent):
   - User confirmed functionality works but pointed out wrong Session 10 content
   - Need to replace with version from nano-degree/tmp folder
   - Copy images from tmp folder to corporate-only
   - Include all documents in encryption
   - Retrieve correct PlantUML files from transcript (7-9am UTC)
   - PlantUML files must include `_shared-styles.puml` not `!theme plain`
   - Replace broken reconstructed versions

The user explicitly wants me to restore the correct corporate Session 10 content and associated files from specific sources they've identified.

Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent:**
   The user's primary request evolved through the session:
   - Initially: Fix multiple issues with corporate content display (images as links, Session 10 visibility, navigation)
   - Critical correction: Make Session 10 navigation conditional (visible in CN, hidden in public) not removed entirely
   - Final request: Replace the incorrectly reconstructed Session 10 content with the correct version from `nano-degree/tmp`, copy associated images, update encryption, and retrieve correct PlantUML files from transcript (7-9am UTC) that use `_shared-styles.puml`

2. **Key Technical Concepts:**
   - Git submodules for corporate content separation
   - AES-GCM encryption for sensitive content
   - JavaScript-based dynamic content loading
   - Base64 data URL conversion for encrypted images
   - Conditional content display based on network detection
   - MkDocs static site generation with Material theme
   - PlantUML diagram generation with style sheets
   - Markdown to HTML conversion with regex patterns

3. **Files and Code Sections:**
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session9_Production_Agent_Deployment.md`
      - Fixed hardcoded Session 10 link to be conditional
      - Added `<div class="<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-corporate-only">` wrapper for corporate-only visibility
      ```html
      <div class="<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-corporate-only" style="display: none;">
      <strong>Next:</strong> <a href="Session10_Enterprise_Integration_Production_Deployment.md">Session 10 - Enterprise Integration →</a>
      </div>
      ```

   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/javascripts/corporate-content-loader.js`
      - Fixed regex order to process images before links
      - Enhanced image path normalization
      - Added base64 conversion for corporate images
      ```javascript
      // Process images BEFORE links to avoid conflicts
      .replace(/!\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g, '<img src="$2" alt="$1">')  // Images first
      .replace(/\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g, '<a href="$2">$1</a>')       // Then links
      ```

   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/javascripts/network-detection.js`
      - Enhanced with dynamic Session 10 navigation injection
      - Added `loadCorporateSession10()` function
      - Conditional navigation based on network detection

4. **Errors and Fixes:**
   - **Session 10 link in public mode (404 error)**:
      - Initially removed link entirely (wrong approach)
      - User correction: "this change is wrong - it must be conditional"
      - Fixed by using conditional `<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-corporate-only` div wrapper

   - **Images showing as links instead of embedded**:
      - Root cause: Regex pattern for links matching before images
      - Fixed by reordering regex replacements (images first, then links)

   - **Base64 images not displaying**:
      - Path normalization wasn't handling all cases correctly
      - Fixed by enhancing `normalizeImagePath()` to handle corporate-only vs shared images
      - Added fallback for shared images to use web paths

5. **Problem Solving:**
   - Solved conditional navigation display using CSS classes and network detection
   - Fixed markdown parsing order to properly render images
   - Implemented dual-path image handling (encrypted corporate vs shared public)
   - All visual issues resolved: images now embed properly, navigation works conditionally

6. **All User Messages:**
   - "works in corporate and publicly (the settings page, session 10 in mod 03). However, the images are not being displayed (they are links instead of embedded images --> md issue, as the links work - they get us to the local version of the image... provided the user has full access to the sub-module content too. Presumably won't work on general user's machines, as they will be missing the sub-module - this content should come from the decrypted json. Not sure, if the md-files of CN content already have a mechanism to display images this way - maybe needs HTML embedded in the md files?)\nIn addition, on the CN only pages, there appears to be no sidebar (MkDocs config).\nAlso, the main sidebar menu in menu 03 only goes to session 9 - this should show session 10 in CN (only)\nFinally, the back link from session 10 (CN version) to session 9 is broken... check all nav links around this new model of transitioning from public content to corporate content.\nvery last: we don't need a session 10 placeholder in public mode, as session 10 is CN only. So, it would need to show session 10 in the sidebar when in CN and not show it when operating in the public domain. Same story for the forward nav link from session 9 to session 10 - should not exist when in public space."
   - "this change is wrong - it must be conditional: in CN the Next link must be there, in the public space it must be hidden"
   - "start the local server and build the mkdocs"
   - "it works from a visibility point of view and the diagrams are now showing as embedded images. However, when re-constructing the information in session 10 (you had accidentally deleted this yesterday), you included the wrong version... the one you reconstructed. Replace this version by the document found in nano-degree/tmp. Also copy the images found in this folder to the corporate only folder and include all of these documents in the encryption file. You will need to adjust the links of course to make it work as expected. In addition, you need to re-construct (/retrieve) the puml files which correspond to these three images. They can be found in the transcript around 7-9am UTC (9-11 CEST). Make sure you retrieve the correct versions - they must include our style sheet (_shared-styles.puml). Then move those retrieved files to corporate-only, replacing the broken ones you had from the attempted reconstruction (they have the wrong style sheet, for example: !theme plain)"

7. **Pending Tasks:**
   - Replace Session 10 content with correct version from `nano-degree/tmp`
   - Copy images from tmp folder to corporate-only folder
   - Include all new documents in encryption file
   - Retrieve correct PlantUML files from transcript (7-9am UTC)
   - Ensure PlantUML files use `_shared-styles.puml` not `!theme plain`
   - Replace broken reconstructed PlantUML files

8. **Current Work:**
   Just completed fixing all display issues:
   - Session 10 navigation now conditional (visible in CN, hidden in public)
   - Images display as embedded content, not links
   - Corporate images served as base64 from encrypted JSON
   - MkDocs server running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/agentic-ai-nano/`

   User just informed me that Session 10 content is wrong (reconstructed version) and needs replacement from tmp folder, plus PlantUML files need correction.

9. **Optional Next Step:**
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request: "Replace this version by the document found in nano-degree/tmp. Also copy the images found in this folder to the corporate only folder and include all of these documents in the encryption file."

   Next steps in order:
   1. Check and copy Session 10 content from `nano-degree/tmp` to corporate-only
   2. Copy associated images from tmp to corporate-only/images
   3. Retrieve correct PlantUML files from transcript (7-9am UTC) that use `_shared-styles.puml`
   4. Replace the broken PlantUML files that have `!theme plain`
   5. Update paths in the documents
   6. Re-run encryption script to include all new content.
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "ls -la /Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/tmp/ | grep -E \"Session10|\\.md|\\.png|\\.puml\"",
  "description": "Check contents of tmp folder for Session 10 files"
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - MkDocs server running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/agentic-ai-nano/`

   User just informed me that Session 10 content is wrong (reconstructed version) and needs replacement from tmp folder, plus PlantUML files need correction.

9. **Optional Next Step:**
   Based on the user's most recent explicit request: "Replace this version by the document found in nano-degree/tmp. Also copy the images found in this folder to the corporate only folder and include all of these documents in the encryption file."

   Next steps in order:
   1. Check and copy Session 10 content from `nano-degree/tmp` to corporate-only
   2. Copy associated images from tmp to corporate-only/images
   3. Retrieve correct PlantUML files from transcript (7-9am UTC) that use `_shared-styles.puml`
   4. Replace the broken PlantUML files that have `!theme plain`
   5. Update paths in the documents
   6. Re-run encryption script to include all new content.
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

**User Request:** This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Looking at this conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial State**: The conversation began with the user reporting multiple issues after the corporate content migration work was completed. They showed screenshots indicating problems with Session 10 accessibility and image display.

2. **User's First Major Feedback**: 
   - Session 10 link still appearing in public mode (leading to 404)
   - Images showing as links instead of embedded images in corporate content
   - Missing sidebar on CN-only pages
   - Session 10 should only appear in CN mode
   - Navigation links around Session 9/10 transition need fixing

3. **My Initial Fixes**:
   - Fixed image display by enhancing corporate content loader with base64 conversion
   - Fixed missing sidebar by refining content area selector
   - Added dynamic Session 10 navigation injection
   - Initially removed Session 10 link from Session 9 entirely

4. **Critical User Correction**: 
   - User interrupted to correct me: "this change is wrong - it must be conditional: in CN the Next link must be there, in the public space it must be hidden"
   - I then properly fixed this using conditional display with `<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-corporate-only` class

5. **Technical Implementation Details**:
   - Fixed markdown-to-HTML conversion by processing images before links (regex order issue)
   - Enhanced image path normalization to handle both corporate-only and shared images
   - Corporate images converted to base64 data URLs from encrypted content
   - Shared images use adjusted web paths

6. **Final User Request** (Most Recent):
   - User confirmed functionality works but pointed out wrong Session 10 content
   - Need to replace with version from nano-degree/tmp folder
   - Copy images from tmp folder to corporate-only
   - Include all documents in encryption
   - Retrieve correct PlantUML files from transcript (7-9am UTC)
   - PlantUML files must include `_shared-styles.puml` not `!theme plain`
   - Replace broken reconstructed versions

The user explicitly wants me to restore the correct corporate Session 10 content and associated files from specific sources they've identified.

Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent:**
   The user's primary request evolved through the session:
   - Initially: Fix multiple issues with corporate content display (images as links, Session 10 visibility, navigation)
   - Critical correction: Make Session 10 navigation conditional (visible in CN, hidden in public) not removed entirely
   - Final request: Replace the incorrectly reconstructed Session 10 content with the correct version from `nano-degree/tmp`, copy associated images, update encryption, and retrieve correct PlantUML files from transcript (7-9am UTC) that use `_shared-styles.puml`

2. **Key Technical Concepts:**
   - Git submodules for corporate content separation
   - AES-GCM encryption for sensitive content
   - JavaScript-based dynamic content loading
   - Base64 data URL conversion for encrypted images
   - Conditional content display based on network detection
   - MkDocs static site generation with Material theme
   - PlantUML diagram generation with style sheets
   - Markdown to HTML conversion with regex patterns

3. **Files and Code Sections:**
   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/03_mcp-acp-a2a/Session9_Production_Agent_Deployment.md`
      - Fixed hardcoded Session 10 link to be conditional
      - Added `<div class="<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-corporate-only">` wrapper for corporate-only visibility
      ```html
      <div class="<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-corporate-only" style="display: none;">
      <strong>Next:</strong> <a href="Session10_Enterprise_Integration_Production_Deployment.md">Session 10 - Enterprise Integration →</a>
      </div>
      ```

   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/javascripts/corporate-content-loader.js`
      - Fixed regex order to process images before links
      - Enhanced image path normalization
      - Added base64 conversion for corporate images
      ```javascript
      // Process images BEFORE links to avoid conflicts
      .replace(/!\[([^\]]*)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g, '<img src="$2" alt="$1">')  // Images first
      .replace(/\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g, '<a href="$2">$1</a>')       // Then links
      ```

   - `/Users/<USER_ID_REDACTED>/Agentic/nano-degree/docs-content/javascripts/network-detection.js`
      - Enhanced with dynamic Session 10 navigation injection
      - Added `loadCorporateSession10()` function
      - Conditional navigation based on network detection

4. **Errors and Fixes:**
   - **Session 10 link in public mode (404 error)**:
      - Initially removed link entirely (wrong approach)
      - User correction: "this change is wrong - it must be conditional"
      - Fixed by using conditional `<COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED>-corporate-only` div wrapper

   - **Images showing as links instead of embedded**:
      - Root cause: Regex pattern for links matching before images
      - Fixed by reordering regex replacements (images first, then links)

   - **Base64 images not displaying**:
      - Path normalization wasn't handling all cases correctly
      - Fixed by enhancing `normalizeImagePath()` to handle corporate-only vs shared images
      - Added fallback for shared images to use web paths

5. **Problem Solving:**
   - Solved conditional navigation display using CSS classes and network detection
   - Fixed markdown parsing order to properly render images
   - Implemented dual-path image handling (encrypted corporate vs shared public)
   - All visual issues resolved: images now embed properly, navigation works conditionally

6. **All User Messages:**
   - "works in corporate and publicly (the settings page, session 10 in mod 03). However, the images are not being displayed (they are links instead of embedded images --> md issue, as the links work - they get us to the local version of the image... provided the user has full access to the sub-module content too. Presumably won't work on general user's machines, as they will be missing the sub-module - this content should come from the decrypted json. Not sure, if the md-files of CN content already have a mechanism to display images this way - maybe needs HTML embedded in the md files?)\nIn addition, on the CN only pages, there appears to be no sidebar (MkDocs config).\nAlso, the main sidebar menu in menu 03 only goes to session 9 - this should show session 10 in CN (only)\nFinally, the back link from session 10 (CN version) to session 9 is broken... check all nav links around this new model of transitioning from public content to corporate content.\nvery last: we don't need a session 10 placeholder in public mode, as session 10 is CN only. So, it would need to show session 10 in the sidebar when in CN and not show it when operating in the public domain. Same story for the forward nav link from session 9 to session 10 - should not exist when in public space."
   - "this change is wrong - it must be conditional: in CN the Next link must be there, in the public space it must be hidden"
   - "start the local server and build the mkdocs"
   - "it works from a visibility point of view and the diagrams are now showing as embedded images. However, when re-constructing the information in session 10 (you had accidentally deleted this yesterday), you included the wrong version... the one you reconstructed. Replace this version by the document found in nano-degree/tmp. Also copy the images found in this folder to the corporate only folder and include all of these documents in the encryption file. You will need to adjust the links of course to make it work as expected. In addition, you need to re-construct (/retrieve) the puml files which correspond to these three images. They can be found in the transcript around 7-9am UTC (9-11 CEST). Make sure you retrieve the correct versions - they must include our style sheet (_shared-styles.puml). Then move those retrieved files to corporate-only, replacing the broken ones you had from the attempted reconstruction (they have the wrong style sheet, for example: !theme plain)"

7. **Pending Tasks:**
   - Replace Session 10 content with correct version from `nano-degree/tmp`
   - Copy images from tmp folder to corporate-only folder
   - Include all new documents in encryption file
   - Retrieve correct PlantUML files from transcript (7-9am UTC)
   - Ensure PlantUML files use `_shared-styles.puml` not `!theme plain`
   - Replace broken reconstructed PlantUML files

8. **Current Work:**
   Just completed fixing all display issues:
   - Session 10 navigation now conditional (visible in CN, hidden in public)
   - Images display as embedded content, not links
   - Corporate images served as base64 from encrypted JSON
   - MkDocs server running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/agentic-ai-nano/`

**User Request:** stop - don't look into the LSL files. Just the nano-degree transcript. Remember that the timestamps in transcripts are UTC --> 2h ahead of us. So, we created this just before 11 (say 10-11) --> should be around 8-9. Or earlier/later.

**Tool:** Bash
**Input:** ```json
{
  "command": "TRANSCRIPT_SOURCE_PROJECT=\"/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree\" CODING_TOOLS_PATH=\"/Users/q284340/Agentic/coding\" timeout 60s node /Users/q284340/Agentic/coding/scripts/enhanced-transcript-monitor.js --debug --timeframe=\"2025-09-18_0800-0900\" --search=\"@startuml\"",
  "description": "Search nano-degree transcript for PlantUML from 8-9am UTC yesterday"
}

**Result:** ❌ Error
