**User Message:** Now we see a lot of **User Request:** (Initiated automatically) again... which probably causes classification to fail - some of the _from-nano-degree files in coding appear to be just "todo lists"

**User Message:** stop - that's garbage. We had this issue before and you fixed it a number of times before. Seems to me that you have managed to, once again, create parallel versions of some of the scripts and you are fixing stuff in one file that we had already fixed in some others. Search through today's transcript for this **User Request:** (Initiated automatically) and find where we fixed it. Masking content is NO OPTION. No content shall be masked (sole exception: /sl (n) commands

2. **First User Message**: The user po...

**User Message:** no - nothing will be skipped. It's a log. Revert your skipping change from earlier. Besides - they are not empty imho. You probably introduced this issue when you added the "Adaptive" transcript schema learner functionality. DEBUG this (breakpoint on the line that prints this "Initiated automatically" and see why it gets triggered. It is - for sure - a logic error in the transcript parsing code!!

**User Message:** don't get it - you did what?\
2. Fixed formatting placeholders (lines 1227 & 1384): Changed from '(Initiated automatically)' to empty string ''\
This doesn't fix the problem that you fail to detect/extract the actual message?!\
And... have you recreated the files? I still see the Initiated automatically all over the place.

**User Message:** did you check the newly created files at all? (I think not) - otherwise you would have seen that... **User Request:** (Initiated automatically)
