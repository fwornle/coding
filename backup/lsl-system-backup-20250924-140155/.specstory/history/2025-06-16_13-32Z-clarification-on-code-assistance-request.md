I'm trying to get you to open our knowledge base visualizer - should be possible like this: 🔧 VSCode Extension Integration Available:
  • @km ukb - Update Knowledge Base (capture insights during chat)
  • @km vkb - View Knowledge Base (visualize knowledge graph)
  • @km search - Search knowledge for relevant patterns
  • @km stats - View knowledge base statistics

💡 Usage in VSCode CoPilot Chat:
  • Start questions with @km to use Knowledge Management
  • Example: @km ukb 'How do I handle async errors in React?'
  • Example: @km search 'logging patterns'

I understand you're trying to use knowledge management commands. Those commands appear to be for a different extension or system that isn't part of standard GitHub Copilot functionality.

The commands you mentioned (`@km vkb`, `@km ukb`, etc.) aren't built into the default GitHub Copilot that I'm running on. These seem to be from a custom Knowledge Management extension that might be available in your organization or as a separate installation.

If you're trying to use knowledge base visualization features:

1. First check if you have the relevant extension installed in VS Code
2. Make sure you're using the correct command syntax for your specific extension
3. If it's a custom tool within your organization, you might need to refer to internal documentation

Would you like me to help you with something else related to your code or project?

_**Assistant**_

I understand you're trying to use the knowledge base visualizer command `@km vkb`. 

This appears to be a command for a custom Knowledge Management extension that isn't part of the standard GitHub Copilot functionality that I operate on. The command syntax suggests it's for visualizing a knowledge graph (`vkb` likely stands for "view knowledge base").

If you're trying to use this feature:

1. Verify that you have the relevant Knowledge Management extension installed in VS Code
2. Check if you need to run this command in a specific context or chat interface
3. Consult your organization's documentation for this custom extension

I can't directly execute or access this Knowledge Management functionality as it's not part of my standard capabilities. Is there something else I can help you with regarding your code or project?

_**Assistant**_

I understand you're trying to use the command `@km vkb` which appears to be for viewing a knowledge base visualization.

This command syntax (`@km vkb`) suggests it's from a custom Knowledge Management extension or system that isn't built into standard GitHub Copilot functionality. Based on your previous message, this seems to be a command to "View Knowledge Base" and visualize a knowledge graph.

I'm not able to directly execute this command or access this Knowledge Management functionality as it's outside my standard capabilities. This appears to be:

1. A custom extension installed in your VS Code environment
2. A specialized integration that might be specific to your organization

If you need help with this functionality, you might want to:
- Check your organization's internal documentation
- Look for installation or usage guides for this Knowledge Management extension
- Consult colleagues who might be familiar with this tooling

Is there something else I can help you with related to your code or development work?
