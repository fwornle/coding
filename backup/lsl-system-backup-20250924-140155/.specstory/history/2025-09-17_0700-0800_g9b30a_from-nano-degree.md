Analyzing this conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Issue**: User reported that Sept 13-14 coding files (from-nano-degree) were missing again, saying "aaaaand once again, our 13. - 14. September "coding" files (from-nano-degree... there are Plenty!!) are gone" and later "nope - no 13/14 files in coding... there should be loads."

**User Message:** So, find out what would need to be extracted and make sure it is extracted then...\
  But there's a third issue: The exchange extraction is not capturing the Sept 13 message that should be classified. Since Sept
  14 files are being created correctly, there must be a format difference in the Sept 13 transcript that's preventing proper
  extraction.

**User Message:** what do you mean - the problem must be elsewhere? --> you just analyzed the root cause of the 13 files not being created. So you should already KNOW what parts of the transcripts are currently not exported, thereby causing the key-word classifier to fail. Can you not make sure that these parts are not missed in the extraction and we are good to go? What exactly are you searching for right now? I'm confused about what you do

**User Message:** where in coding do you see the 13/14 (/15/16) files? I only see 12 then 17. On what basis did you just confirm that everything works. Did you run tests? this one?\
