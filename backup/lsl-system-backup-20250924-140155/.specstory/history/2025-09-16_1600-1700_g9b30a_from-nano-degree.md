## Key Activities

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-16 14:21:08 UTC [16:21:08 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Message:** I don't know what exactly you were looking at, but in the local repo, the first file I open already has **User Request:** (Initiated automatically) in it. In coding, there are no 13th again, no 14th ... which, as we KNOW, had to do with the old vs. new format during parsing - seems you just broke that again.

**Type:** Text-only exchange (no tool calls)

### Text Exchange - 2025-09-16 14:38:21 UTC [16:38:21 CEST] (Redirected)

**User Message:** where is the content for 13 & 14 then? (should all be coding). And why is this exchange '/Users/q284340/Agentic/nano-degree/.specstory/history/2025-09-12_1100-1200_g9b30a.md' --> **User Message:** so, in 2 minutes we should get a new LSL (1830-1930)
 not re-directed? (it has keyword LSL in it!!)?
