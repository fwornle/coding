**User Message:** explain to me why you did not have unit tests for the streaming functionality to catch such a massive mistake (function not defined - this should have NEVER be deployed). Do you not have requirements for all these functions and do we not have tests to make sure each block works as expected? Analyze for what parts of the LSL/classification system we have what tests and what gaps we have. Then clone and install this MCP server https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#readme into ~/Agent...

**User Message:** Analyze the LSL/classification system codebase to identify what tests exist and what critical gaps we have. Focus on:

1. Find all existing test files in the codebase
2. Identify what components have tests vs what don't
3. Specifically analyze if StreamingTranscriptReader, ReliableCodingClassifier, EnhancedTranscriptMonitor have unit tests
4. Identify the critical gap that allowed the "processor function not defined" bug to escape
5. Create a comprehensive testing strategy to prevent such failur...

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all technical details and user requests:

1. **Initial Problem Report**: User reported missing Sept 13-14 coding files with frustration: "aaaaand once again, our 13. - 14. September "coding" files (from-nano-degree... there are Plenty!!) are gone"

2. **My Initial Investigation**: I examined the classific...
