<summary>v7.0 Health Monitoring Consolidation -- Phase 33</summary>

### Phase 33: Health Monitoring Consolidation

**Goal:** Replace the four-layer host watchdog stack and parallel readers of `.health/*.json` with a single coordinator process owning one HTTP-served Single Source of Truth on `localhost:3034`, exposing per-session keyed entries, enforcing a 10s p95 detection SLA, and eliminating sledgehammer auto-heals — such that the dashboard at `:3032`, the constraint dashboard at `:3030`, the statusline daemon, the prompt-hook, and the in-container `/api/health-verifier/status` endpoint all derive their answer from the SAME SoT and never disagree.

**Plans:** 7/8 plans executed

Plans:
**Wave 1**
- [x] 33-01-PLAN.md — Wave 0 foundation: extract `lib/utils/log-rotator.js` and create test harness scaffold (10 files under `scripts/__tests__/health-coordinator/`)
- [x] 33-02-PLAN.md — Coordinator skeleton: `scripts/health-coordinator.js` (Express on `0.0.0.0:3034`, in-memory state, 4 endpoints, EADDRINUSE handler) + launchd plist (NOT loaded yet)

**Wave 2** *(blocked on Wave 1 completion)*
- [x] 33-03-PLAN.md — Coordinator behavior: rules loader + check registry + 5s tick + Docker `.State.Health.Status` passthrough + per-check error isolation (R6)

**Wave 3** *(blocked on Wave 2 completion)*
- [x] 33-04-PLAN.md — Reporter conversion: reduce `health-verifier.js` and `statusline-health-monitor.js` to reporter mode; add `lsl_heartbeat` POST to `enhanced-transcript-monitor.js`

**Wave 4** *(blocked on Wave 3 completion)*
- [x] 33-05-PLAN.md — Reader migration: rewrite `health-prompt-hook.js`, dashboard backend (`server.js`, 4 routes), and constraint-monitor backend (`dashboard-server.js`, 2 routes) to fetch from coordinator

**Wave 5** *(blocked on Wave 4 completion)*
- [x] 33-06-PLAN.md — Rules cleanup: delete `bind_mount_freshness` and `supervisord_status` from `health-verification-rules.json`; delete `refreshBindMounts()` and any `--force-recreate` from `health-remediation-actions.js`
- [x] 33-07-PLAN.md — Cutover: add `HEALTH_COORDINATOR_URL` to `docker-compose.yml`; rebuild container; delete 4 legacy daemon scripts; bootout legacy plist + bootstrap new plist; clean stale `.health/*.json`; human verify

**Wave 6** *(blocked on Wave 5 completion)*
- [ ] 33-08-PLAN.md — Acceptance: run all 13 SPEC AC checks against the cutover system; write `33-VERIFICATION-PRECHECK.md`; human verify

## Backlog

### Phase 999.1: Extract Shared LLM Adapter Library (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Extract `lib/llm/` to a shared submodule used by coding and rapid-automations/OKB. Add direct HTTP path for Claude Max (OAuth token from keychain -> Anthropic API, no CLI spawn) to eliminate 12-15s latency. Copilot provider already does direct HTTP (~2-5s) -- same pattern for claude-code.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd-review-backlog when ready)
