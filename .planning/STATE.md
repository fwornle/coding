# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-24)

**Core value:** A self-learning coding environment that captures every session, builds knowledge, prevents mistakes, and makes observations browsable -- across all AI coding agents.
**Current focus:** Phase --phase — 30

## Current Position

Phase: 30-claude-hook-adapter — COMPLETE
Plan: 1 of 1 (done)
Status: Phase 30 complete
Last activity: 2026-04-25 -- Phase 30 plan 01 completed

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 6 (v6.0)
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v6.0 start]: Agent-agnostic architecture -- retrieval service is standalone HTTP API, each coding agent has its own adapter
- [v6.0 start]: Use existing Qdrant instance for vector storage (not LibSQL vector)
- [v6.0 start]: All four knowledge tiers as sources (observations, digests, insights, KG entities)
- [v6.0 start]: Mastra-inspired but adapted -- their Observer/Reflector pattern maps to our existing ETM/consolidation pipeline
- [v6.0 roadmap]: Embedding pipeline is strict foundation -- nothing works without vectors in Qdrant
- [v6.0 roadmap]: Retrieval service runs host-side (not Docker) to avoid SQLite WAL lock contention
- [v6.0 roadmap]: Claude hook is primary adapter -- prove value before other agents
- [v6.0 roadmap]: fastembed with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim) pinned as embedding model
- [v6.0 roadmap]: Token budget default ~1000 tokens (research recommends 800-1000, not the 2K initially planned)
- [28-01]: EmbeddingModel.AllMiniLML6V2 enum verified at runtime; queryEmbed returns Float32Array converted via Array.from()
- Deterministic UUID from KG entity keys via MD5 hash for Qdrant point IDs
- Fire-and-forget Redis publish with fail-fast retryStrategy ensures observation writes never block on embedding
- Plain JS for src/retrieval/ modules to match server.js consumer and avoid TS compilation step
- Import compiled dist/embedding/ outputs from retrieval modules (not raw src/embedding/ TS)
- Added src/retrieval bind-mount to docker-compose.yml for retrieval modules in Docker
- Set absolute cacheDir in FlagEmbedding.init() to prevent CWD-relative model loading
- Reset _initPromise on failure for retry support in RetrievalService
- [30-01]: Plain JS hook with MIN_WORDS=4 threshold, fail-open HTTP with 2s timeout + 5s safety ceiling

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 28]: Verify Docker base image supports fastembed (requires glibc/Debian, not Alpine)
- [Phase 32]: OpenCode plugin injection API needs runtime validation before implementation
- [Phase 32]: Copilot per-prompt injection may not be supported -- may need refresh daemon approach
